Chad has been awesome with the kids and holding down the fort while I work later than usual! The kids have been busy together playing Skylander on the XBox together, after Kyan cashed in his $$$ from his piggy bank. He wanted that game so bad and used his gift card from his birthday he has been saving and the money to get it (he never taps into that thing either, that is how we know he wanted it so bad). We made him count all of his money to make sure that he had enough! It was very cute to watch his reaction when he realized he did! He also does a very good job of letting Lola feel like she is playing too, by letting her switch out the characters! She loves it almost as much as him.
so anyways, i am going to share some home decor inspiration that i have been storing in my folder on the puter. i have all these amazing images stored away ready to come to life when we get our home.
With graduation season right around the corner, Nancy has whipped up a fun set to help you out with not only your graduation cards and gifts, but any occasion that brings on a change in one's life. I stamped the images in Memento Tuxedo Black and cut them out with circle Nestabilities. I embossed the kraft and red cardstock with TE's new Stars Impressions Plate, which is double sided and gives you 2 fantastic patterns. You can see how to use the Impressions Plates in this tutorial Taylor created. Just one pass through your die cut machine using the Embossing Pad Kit is all you need to do - super easy!

Other friends have similar stories, of how they were treated brusquely by Laurelwood staff, and as often as not, the same names keep coming up. About a half-dozen friends of mine refuse to step foot in there ever again because of it. How many others they’re telling - and keeping away - one can only guess.
Although our beloved Cantab can’t claim the international recognition afforded the Station Inn, otherwise these two joints feel like twins separated by nothing more than distance.

Peter Schiff: Hard to tell. It will look pretty bad for most Americans when prices will go way up and they can’t afford to buy stuff. It could also get very bad as far as loss of individual liberty. A lot of people will blame it on capitalism, on freedom, and they will claim we need more government. It could be used as an impetus for more regulation, which would be a disaster, or it could be an impetus to get rid of all the regulation that was causing the problem. But whether we will do the right or the wrong thing here in America, there will be a lot of pain first. We got some serious problems we have to deal with, but we are not dealing with the problems, we only make the problems worse.
3. Winter is the time when all sleeps on some level. It is a time of turning within to make contact with your own innermost being. Winter is the best time to do this and, as a result, get answers for yourself about whatever concerns you. It is also a tremendously creative time, a time for artists of all kinds to turn within and to seek images of forms he or she wishes to produce in whatever medium chosen, so that an image of balance can be presented. Those of you that write, we suggest that you do so to come up with plots and ideas that will speak of balance coming to an imbalanced situation, person, or world. To those of you who, like Priscilla, work with making patterns and designs, we would say remember the images and designs brought about by winter. White will challenge you to see what changes will manifest in the images you produce. We ask that you do this in your own environment.
I am en-route to Cornwall again. 3/4 months of slog and sun and sea too. Always a job needs doing in a tourist town. I’m bringing my stuff back from 97 on Friday. Will need to cancel bills before I retreat. Not such a bad thing. Moved to Leeds with promise from Millies. That went nowhere. Move on.

The one thing that was astounding though was the support from the marshals – they were all phenomenal for being out in the rain for so long and remaining so cheery and supportive. They were an amazing bunch. Owing to the nature of the course and very few closed roads meant that supporters who knew the area were able to skip around the course and a few people were seen about 5 or 6 times which was also super!!

A neighbor recommended “Chasing Fireflies” by Charles Martin. I’d never read anything by Martin before, although he was this neighbor’s favorite author. “Fireflies” is the story of Chase, a journalist who never knew his parents and was adopted by “Unc,” a colorful resident of a small Georgia town whose sayings and kind heart make him a memorable character. Chase is investigating the story of another orphan, this one a mute boy pushed out of a car on train tracks just before a train hit and killed his loser custodial “parent.”

Either Obama/Congress, etc. give in or, more likely, refuse. The group announces that the next device will be detonated in a populated area, with no warning. Again, “Obama,” et al., refuse to submit. This time the device is detonated in a mid-sized to major city. Tens of thousands die. (Think the atomic bombs that ended WWII.)
April was a month for new beginnings. Firstly, I finally finished my exams, and if all is good, I’ll be graduating in May. It still feels weird to know that the business degree I’ve been working for four years is finally mine. So now I’m in the process of looking for a new job. Secondly, I finally began moving in with my boyfriend of four years, and that’s a bit nerve-wrecking. As for reading books, the last week of April gave me an opportunity to relax and enjoy a few stories. As you will see, I have not finished much, but I have successfully began several hefty novels. I am happy with the progress I’ve made so far and the quality of books I’ve picked to read. The Fellowship of the Ring is surprisingly easy to read, considering all my fears about Tolkien and his writing. I am loving A Clash of Kings even though this season took a few liberties concerning the plot. Master and Margarita is my first Russian novel in a long time, and I have to say it’s surprisingly refreshing. I had to postpone my Virginia Woolf experience for later, as I find that I am just not in the mood for it. I should be returning to it a bit later.

When I was four years of age I remember being at home with my mom one day when a salesman tried breaking into our home. My mom was on the phone to her sister when the guy tried every door in the house. Her and I was curled up in a corner of the kitchen hiding with the phone hoping the guy would leave. It scarred me. I have never been trusting of them since this and I haven’t had one that has changed my mind.

Let’s say hypothetically, there is a bomb threat inside an airport. And there is only 10 minutes remaining it will explode. Inside the building there are few whites, blacks and Asian/middle eastern descents. And one of them has the code to disarm the bomb. So what would law enforcement do in a situation like this? Conduct a random check? Or eliminate the best possibilities by checking the Middle Eastern people first? If there are statistics and reasons to believe that threat comes from a certain race, is it unlawful to profile them? If a white man goes on a killing spree then should we waste time checking black men? Same goes to blacks or any other race. Isn’t it simple and smart to stay on facts and statistics or waste time and money by trying to be politically right?

I have it on good authority that everyone in this company, particularly the strikers, recieved gifts in the company-organised Secret Santa. I also know that the strikers attended the company-funded Xmas Party, where they partook in the company-funded luncheon. They also recieved vouchers to the value of K100, from the company as Xmas gifts.
I've also pondered a more permanent solution that involves several smaller chronological blogrolls organized by blog type (like the color codes). But that seems like a lot of work to create and maintain, and I'm not sure it would be helpful to the reader.

How many times have you heard someone say that so-and-so is too nice to tell the person they’re seeing that they want to call it quits, too nice to address unfair working conditions with their employer or too nice to ask someone to stop using that seat on the subway as a foot stool? There certainly are people who are soft-spoken and decidedly non-confrontational. But that doesn’t mean they’re nicer relative to everyone else. It’s just their personality. You can be assertive, honest and even outspoken and still be a very nice person.

On The Lovin’ People, he has the benefit of a good backing band consisting of Pretty Purdie on drums, Artie Butler on organ & piano, and Joe Mack and Bill Salter on bass. The band, who play both loose and funky without ever sounding sloppy, helped produce a more laid back vibe and Chandler sounds more relaxed than he did on the earlier album. He has some better songs on this one, too, such as the title cut warm, poppy number about...well, “Lovin’ People,” on which the presence of a chorus (made up on the spot of people who had gathered to provide assistance to a mothers’ help organization) also helps temper Chandler’s unfortunate tendency towards over-earnestness. “The Naked Fool” is about a relationship gone bad, which doesn’t have anything new to say but will have a few toes tapping. “Sold Out, No More Reservations” is an interesting number about a male groupie, and “Bound to Fly” has a nice soaring quality, and Chandler’s lyrics and delivery mesh well on it. If anything the problem here is that Chandler is sometimes eclipsed by his backing band—check “Behind Your Eyes” where the band goes off on some nice free jazz-psychedelic tangents while Chandler seems to be trying to channel Sammy Davis, Jr.
I was worried I wasn’t going to like this. And not because I have an unhealthy love of comic book heroes and unrealistic expectations. No, I was worried because it seems the 98% of people I know had already seen it and enjoyed it. Even the wife. Thus, wading in with an opinion of ‘pfft…shite’ would prove about as popular as punching a kitten in the face. But in the end the fears proved unfounded as I really did like it.

Ah, Parga. How many times have we sat in Paxos, looking across at the mainland at night seeing twinkling lights in the far distance? How many times have we wondered just what was it like over there? Well now we know. Unfortunately the place with the twinkling lights was not Parga but some other little community. We got it wrong. Parga was on the itinerary anyway. We concluded it was not worth the detour; two resort-y bays separated by an ancient Turkish fort on a steep hill and a cluster of souvenir shops, tavernas and restaurants. The marina was unwelcoming - we moored alongside a rusting, capsized ferry - and the trudge to buy some provisions took us along a neglected rubbish strewn track. Thomas would not leave the boat for fear we were robbed. But hey! Pull up the gangplank, crack open a beer and experiment with cooking in the galley.

I napped after studio class tonight. Andrew and I were up really late last night, despite going to bed at a somewhat decent time. We ended up talking to each other for about an hour and a half to two hours just about our lives and what was going on and stuff like that. It was a very nice talk, but it made me tired for today, which explains why I’m still awake now. But don’t worry…I’ll be getting to bed shortly, right after I shower.

Smokers I have little sympathy for – you made that decision, in the face of all the evidence that it’s not just seriously harmful to you, but to everyone around you, so I’m sorry, but you get to live with the consequences. And had I not lived, worked and socialised among smokers for most of my life, until the ban, I wouldn’t be anywhere near as ill as I am now, so sympathy is in very short supply.

- Food and drink disliking. I’m not really sure what the correct term is for this, but I developed a dislike for almost all of the foods that I once liked, and couldn’t drink fizzy pop at all! I think I may have literally lived on pickled onion space raiders and fruit juice for the entire first trimester…and possibly a lot of the second.
I recently tried a super fabulous restaurant that you MUST MUST try. I usually don't give restaurant recommendations, so trust me on this one. I decided to go down to South Norwalk and check out The SoNo Baking Company and Cafe that Martha Stewart is always yammering on about on Martha. This tiny hidden jewel was started by John Barricelli, who works for Martha and also hosts Everyday Baking on PBS. It is Fa. Bu. Lous. Seriously, that good. We had lunch and I tried a Cobb Salad that elevated the usual blah salad to a culinary masterpiece. I sat at the counter in front of a huge glass window and watched people roll out chocolate croissants with a vintage roller while I ate. (If you are a big geek, that is a huge thrill.) At one point in the meal, I actually saw John Barricelli through the glass instructing one of the bakers on how to place the chocolate chunks perfectly in the croissant. I considered banging on the glass to blow kisses and get my photo taken with him but I decided I had done that enough recently with both her and her, so I decided to play it cool and just eat my lunch quietly. I also brought home a huge selection of pastries and enjoyed every single one (in the name of research, not gluttony, mind you). John is coming out with a cookbook in early March. You can be a geek like me and pre-order your copy on Amazon today. The cafe is located right near the South Norwalk Aquarium and makes a good drive on a cold winter's day.

Of course it goes without saying that all the music above would probably have been familiar to Gardel's audience, too. But it's not that widely known here. It's not difficult or inaccessible music, but it's not a routine part of the popular culture in the same way that it would have been when Gardel was playing El dia que mi quieras, or even as it was when my grandmother's relations were making their own entertainment in Australia with performances of Bizet's Au fond du temple saint.

Valentines Day falls on February 14th each year. It is a holiday in which lovers express said love for each other, traditionally with flowers, candle lit dinners, heart shaped things, chocolate and greeting cards. The first Valentines cards were hand written but over time have made way for more mass produced greetings. These cards, for the most part, depict images of hearts, cupids and love struck victims.

Roughly a week later, my sister and her ever-expanding family drove in from Alaska and picked me up, and then we all headed on to Alvin, Texas, once a happy place where a son would be reunited with his father, but now a haunted little town where ghosts of memories reared their teeth at every turn. We pulled into the driveway at dusk, greeted by my stepmother and stepbrother, both of who appeared to be much stronger than me.

The product is a milky white liquid that applies like emulsion, not too creamy and thick, but not like water (or jelly) either. After spreading it out on your face, it dries within a few minutes. After which the fun begins! According to the SA, after it dries, you start rubbing it like you’re trying to rub dirt off your face, until you rub off most of it. If required, wash off the remaining with lukewarm water. So I started rubbing and it actually takes quite a bit of effort to rub it all off! It comes off in little bits like you’re rubbing off a layer of your skin.

Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, at the end of the kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision.
I have mixed emotions about the start to this book. As I’ve already mentioned I very much enjoyed the characters and the voice of the protagonist. But as much as I was enjoying it, it took me a little while to get into the story. We’re presented with a huge case of insta-love right from the start. Lucas, the mysterious and hot new neighbor, comes on strong. I’m pretty sure they start making out on their second or third meeting! I’m warning you now. There’s not a lot of rationalization for the insta-love…you won’t really understand the reasons until the end of the book. Which is why, in retrospect, I kinda like that I had to wait for all of the info to be revealed.

Sometimes, I just want to read a book. It’s kinda like Freud said, “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” Well in my case, sometimes I just need to read an actual hard or soft cover book, feel the paper against my fingers, smell the newness or musty oldness. If it’s a new book, there is something quite satisfying about being the first one to crack it open. I love to turn the pages, hear the crinkle and switch as my fingers brush against the paper.

I think I did three sets of revisions in the end. The first involved clarifying the plot. I kept moving away from the main thread and rambling in different directions. Once I’d mastered that I had to switch some chapters round and cut some bits out then work a little on the dialogue. Plotting has been the most difficult part of writing so far. But through writing Shine, I studied plot hard, learned a lot and with my second book, Glitter, due out on Sept. 2nd, I had one small amount of editing to do. I kept waiting for Rachel to send the MS back with more to do when I discovered it was already with the copyeditor!

This stuff is actually happening. It’s threatening our survival. And it’s not just the environment. And I’m writing it to know that, among the peaceful: you are not crazy for thinking that we are approaching a turning point in our country where the realities of decades of profit-over-all-else mentality are becoming not just undeniable, but are confronting us in our day to day lives in ways we did not think was possible in a country that now seems, in retrospect, to have been the least Western, least democratically-minded country to be considered so. And that turning point might require widespread civil disobedience, in the name of the environmental and economic survival of our country and our people (as well, of course, as the vast masses like us all around the world, in other countries).

There came a point, maybe three years into that, where I began to realise I'd have to have another go at a novel. Giant Thief didn't originate with any one story, but it did come out of not wanting to make the mistakes I'd made with my first attempt at novel writing. I was writing one or two short stories a month, and I didn't want to lose that pace. So it had to be something fast-paced, fun, not too convoluted. Something I could throw myself into and just keep moving with.

In reporting on activities to Chloe, I invented the chick-flick scale, my very own movie rating system. Instead of stars, chick flicks get 1 to 4 hearts (of course). Here are mini reviews of the movies I've watched this past week or so.

Alyssa is now 10 and has been busy with Volleyball, Girlscouts, and Sunday School. It seems like we are always running with her somewhere. She was struggling in reading in school a few months back, and was put into special reading help class; which was in turn taking time away from her math time and causing her to struggle in math; but she has now caught up with her reading, and has turned her math skills around as well. Conferences are just around the corner, and we have high hopes for her. We repainted her room for her last Birthday and gave her all new bedding and furniture. She has more things in her room, than time to play with the stuff...but what kid doesn't I guess.We don't get to see her as much as we would like to, but we cherish the time we do get with her. We have a lot of fun things planned to do with her on the weekends we have with her, let's hope we don't wear her out!
The concept of the King's Peace first appeared during the reign of Richard I in 1195. Peace was henceforth to be seen as the responsibility of the king, and its breach required that the culpable parties be answerable to him. During the reign of Edward III in 1361, Justices of the Peace were appointed for the first time. The Crown, in effect, was claiming a monopoly on violence in the realm, and appointing officials to enforce it.
The black sports coat, white button-up shirt, khaki slacks, and leather loafers he wore were all tailored and very expensive giving the impression of him being some sort of major player in the world trying to lay low and relax. It was a thought that Peter was beginning to believe more and more about himself as his sales numbers rocketed into orbit.
After the war memorial, and Northwood Station, we turned right just after St Helen's School towards Northwood Hills. My two South London colleagues were pleased that there actually was a hill. We were surprised at the number of closed-down shops in this apparently affluent area, but the William Jolle pub still seemed to be thriving. (Because it is a Wetherspoons establishment, I can tell you that he was a local 14th century resident) The former pub opposite had, however, metamorphosed into the Namaste Lounge.

The only not-so-fabulous part was that as I was getting the monkeys in the tub, I started to sneeze. And feel drippy and tickly. Sure signs of an end-of-summer cold. Bluck. I feel icky this morning, but have too much to do to be sick. So I am refusing to succumb to my desire to plop on the couch and sniff all day. I am hoping sheer will alone will heal me :)
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for teaching me to prayer earnest, heartfelt and continued prayers. As I spend time to pray like this today, Your divine power is manifested, changes are effected, and circumstances in my life are changed, in Jesus Christ Name I pray! Amen!
Last week, he was so worked up about some things that were not actually real. He laid down in his bed and kept going over and over them with me. I told him he just needed to relax, that he didn't need to worry so much. He is being so well cared for. He gave me the silent soul searching steel blue stare, softly grabbed my hand, and said, "I'll always remember you."

From Peru, we flew to Ecuador and then on to the wedding. After the celebrations, we were off to Hawaii, for a much needed relaxing beach holiday, after which we did a wonderful cruise of The Great Barrier Reef, before flying home via Singapore. What a great trip that was, and one day I’ll put some more photos up for you to see.
I gave Nick S a call before I got there and he told me that Tim CC was on his way up to get it, so I did a quick pass 500′ over a couple of pilots on takeoff, then headed back over Aber.
This race is a top-notch way to break into the triple digits for the first time. That’s why I keep coming back and I always bring others with me. The volunteers are wonderful. The food and support system is exceptional. And the race direction is flawlessly efficient. Joe Prusaitis certainly knows how to put on a quality event! Those of us that stuck around for the award ceremony brought home a special Texas Trinket for being one of the most interesting out-of-town groups.

When it comes to making my own salsas at home, I've often limited myself to making the usual salsas that involve fresh tomatoes, fresh jalapenos, an onion, some cilantro and a bit of lime juice... or pico de gallo. And from time to time, I may make the salsa verde, guacamole, or the black bean and corn salsa.... even the quick, budget-friendly avocado sauce. They are all excellent. But recently I managed to make 2 different salsas, opening the door to a new way of making salsa for me... using various chiles to add depth and flavor.

That’s why there’s cache. Cache-memory access is almost as fast as register access, but you can have a lot of cache memory—comparatively. L1 caches typically have 32 or 64Kbyte capacities and often there are independent caches for instructions and data. Caches take a huge load off main memory, relieving the pressure to speed up main-memory access.
“When one has seen one house he has seen them all, the same everlasting high stoops and gloomy brown-stone fronts, the same number of holes punched in exactly the same places,” Osman quotes a late 19th century writer as lamenting. “The new brownstone and trolley grid inspired 19th century eulogies for a real and imagined agricultural landscape,” Osman writes.
Anyway, Howl is the dashing wizard that Sophie fell in love with. He was self-absorbed. In the movie it was said that Howl’s heart was young and immature (something like that). At first he wasn’t capable of loving anyone. I guess to be able to understand the film, we have to understand Howl’s relationship with Calcifer.

The message of Journey of the Universe shows how we are not just a part of this astonishing process, we are at the very edge of evolution, a primate species that has found in its language and symbols the power to take over the very evolutionary process itself. But this control that we now exercise comes with a responsibility; and viewers of Journey of the Universe will not only be imbued with a sense of astonishment at all that has taken place, they will also come to feel the excitement in learning that now we live in a time when the human species is being asked to play a central role in activating the flourishing powers of Earth’s living systems.
They are both chunky knits and were a complete bargain-the green was £1 and the multi colour knit was £2!! The charity shops have now started putting out their winter stocks so using these knits as inspiration, why don't you go and hunt down a stylish cosy bargain for much less than the high street or designer versions?
Skully was struggling to breath at this point, shaking and pawing his head, gagging and his eyes reflected his fear. Poor little guy! He was also snapping his teeth, tryin' to dislodge the jerky.

Freddie did spend some time in Vietnam too; I think he told us he used to make maps there. But we never pushed it because who knew if he would “Freak out” about it. And Freddie knew just about everything you know, politics, art, religion, history, philosophy, and most important, Brooklyn.

Again, I’ve just begun working on what Mr. Licata told me and I’ll post more later but if its true, it would make a great book: corrupt lawyers, bribed judges and completely crooked bankers engaging in mortgage fraud and outright theft. Real estate slows down from about the end of May and won’t really resume until September so maybe I’ll devote some of that free time to writing this up – it’s got the ingredients for a great tale.
I was recently given the assignment to select one word that describes me and write about it. At first this sounded so simple, but in my usual fashion I spent a little too much time dwelling over it. I wear many badges. I am a wife, a mother, a daughter, a teacher, a friend....you get my point. The word that returned to me most often and a word I've never used to describe myself was pray-er, a person that prays. I questioned if it was really a word...it is...I looked it up. It is seldom used, but it is a word.
It's official, I made the 2012 Spellbinders team. It's been an amazing year and I am so glad that it doesn't have to end. I love this company, their products, their values, and the people who make Spellbinders what it is.
Or at least, the US does. Why don’t things like this exist? Adults like to have fun as much as kids do, although maybe the urge to play has either died down naturally or been repressed by responsibilities. Playgrounds are a great way for kids to run, jump, and get some exercise while enjoying themselves, but what like that exists for adults? If you want fun, it’s usually either expensive or relatively sedentary like walking or hiking. If you want cheap exercise … lace up those running shoes. (And I don’t deny that some people gain enjoyment from running, but I sure don’t.)
And the paint. I have read every blog and article on the web that discusses painting cabinets and I tried something completely different from what I had read. Have you seen those commercials for Behr "He is painting while he primes. She is priming while she paints?" I went for the premium primer included stuff from Home Depot. The black color is Behr Beluga. I painted 3 coats, sanding lightly between each one. I didn't remove the doors but I easily could (and probably should) have. I decided to distress them. This my husband wasn't too thrilled about but I know how my kids and their stool had already distressed them over the years so I figured I would save myself the headache and heartache and have them start distressed. I hit it several places with the sander and then used a darker tinted glaze (some watered down acrylic craft paint) over the sanded spots to darken up the distressed areas.
I’m pretty late to the LCD Soundsystem party (a great oversight on my part), but thankfully rectified with Mr James Murphy’s third (and final?) outing of liquid crystal disco. It sounds effortlessly cool, but there’s so much going on, it’s just plain fun to listen to, dance to and do just about anything to – be it the washing up, filling out an application form or being attacked by PANDUHS!

During this time, peaceful occupiers have been faced with continual harassment arrests, almost invariably on fabricated charges (“disorderly conduct,” “interfering with the conduct of a police officer”—the latter a charge that can be leveled, for instance, against those who try to twist out of the way when an officer is hitting them.) I have seen one protestor at Union Square arrested, by four officers using considerable force, for sitting on the ground to pet a dog; another, for wrapping a blanket around herself (neither were given warnings; but both behaviors were considered too close to “camping”); a third, an ex-Marine, for using obscene language on the Federal steps. Others were reportedly arrested on those same steps for singing a satirical version of the “Officer Krumpke” song from West Side Story. Almost no march goes by without one or two protestors, at least, being hurled against vehicles or have their heads bashed against the ground while being arrested for straying off the sidewalk. The message here is clear. Law has nothing to do with it. Anyone who engages in Occupy Wall Street-related activity should know they can be arrested, for virtually any reason, at any time.
6. Meyerman - Who Do You Think You Are?
I'm a voracious reader. Always have been. As a teenager, my parents ended up having to hide my books so I would get my chores done because I would spend every chance I got reading. It didn't really change when I had a family, except no one had to hide my books so I'd get my chores done. :P

I'm in the process of building out an entire enchanted forest in one inch scale as part of my set for the Myrtle short film. Trees complete with faces and jelly jars hanging from the branches filled with fireflies / will o' the wisps. It's starting to look pretty good and I'm pleased with how the glass jars light up. They're all hand-blown glass and less than 1 cm in height. So like me, this project is pretty teeny.

Data-mining programs will provide these abusers of power with powerful tools for creating enemies lists, and for targeting them, as described in EFAD. Social media networks are already under intensive federal scrutiny. This year, it is ostensibly to track down undefined terrorist threats. But social media, so popular today, must be understood as a two-edged sword. The same social media that facilitated the Arab Spring, today brings the secret police of Syria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other nations to the doors of obscure bloggers hidden in tiny apartments, to drag them away to secret torture cells.
I was walking back from my girlfriend’s house through Park South, a notoriously run-down area of Swindon, riddled with unemployment, anti-social behaviour and crime. It’s not the area of Swindon I normally associate with a ‘passion for politics’, but as I crossed the water logged field I saw a purple and yellow glow from a window. ‘VOTE UKIP’. Wait, what? – This took me by surprise, Park South has always been a Labour stronghold, we have all seen it in the media that the ‘smaller’ parties are going to do well tomorrow, but this really hit home for me. It’s bitter-sweet.

Due to the nature of my job (raising children) I find my cleaning standards have slipped somewhat. After a day spent washing up, sweeping food off the kitchen floor, wiping all the surfaces, picking up toys and random objects up off every floor in the house, cooking, looking after my kids, making beds, and hanging washing out, seventeen times over, I have no remaining energy to do any actual cleaning.

But wait, broadcast industry opponents say. Aren’t broadcasters the rich and powerful few disenfranchising the rest of the country from having ubiquitous wireless broadband? Only they won’t say it quite like that, but the point is worth examining. Just 10 to 15 percent of U.S. households rely exclusively on over-the-air television. There is some evidence of cord-cutting–i.e., people ditching pay service for free TV–but not to the extent to suggest that ratio will double anytime soon. And we don’t know much yet about the adoption rate of mobile over-the-air TV because where is it already?
Our system is broken. Government serves the interest of big business and big business only serves the interest of a very few, wealthy elites. It’s time to make our economy and our politics work for working people.

I was nervous about reading this passage. It's pretty emotional. That's some crazy brutality, you know? They aren't dying fast enough as they slowly suffocate on a cross where they are hanging by their hands and feet so let's break their legs so they die faster. Oh- he's already dead so let's put a gash in his side so that he bleeds.

Was hoping I would only have to beat cancer once, but the disease continues to foolishly pick on the wrong guy.
I've got to admit that I didn't know the Norfolk Broads was water, for some reason I just imagined it being fields. We learned little bits about it along the way, like they're man-made, but I did a bit more research here and have learned that the Broads is now the UK's largest nationally protected wetland. They are a man-made creation, formed when people dug for peat! Who knew?
“I don’t think that is the best way for having these changes. I don’t know on what basis they are going to charge us. The best option is dialogue,” said Asfaw Dingamo, Ethiopia’s minister of water resources.
I rode from my house to RC1's house and when I was just about there I came to a place in the trail where it stopped suddenly with friendly 'no trespassing' signs suggesting that I find another route. Instead, I picked up my bike and crossed the rail road tracks anyway. That experience loosely parallels my week. Pushing forward, creating my own path... That or a silly rummycube analogy about switching around the tiles until they fit just right. I like thinking in metaphor.
The juices today were the best yet. Breakfast was like a chilled, spiced carrot soup and lunch was like a thin salsa. Plus I had the Chocolate Nut Milk again for dinner because it was so enjoyable last night.

The morning was HARSH. Anytime I completely lose it to that extent (see yesterdays posts), I always wake up feeling like I got ran over by a semi-truck. My body did NOT want to move and I hurt SO bad. I was late getting DD to school, but I got her there. And from that point on……I’m pretty sure Hell froze over.
The wisdom of the world is still foolish today. One of the great discussion topics of our age is how we get to heaven. The pervasive world view is that everybody will get there some day depending on what you’re looking for. The world’s view claims it doesn’t matter which path you follow to get there. Many in the world’s intellectual and scientific communities believe heaven and hell don’t even exist. We who are being saved, however, know that Jesus would not have gone to the cross if He did not know there was something beyond this world. Those of us who are being saved also know human wisdom costs a person everything, but Godly wisdom affords us everything.

We’ll have faith because we’re clean — not just because of what Jesus did — but because we lived in Him, righteous, by His grace we overcame. We didn’t shrink back. We made sure that we stayed right with Him. We’re supposed to walk like Jesus walked. We can’t just do our own thing and think it’s okay because of some formula. “Without holiness, no man will see God.”

She uses a cat litter with self-absorption-odor absorption qualities unequaled in history.We have invented so many devices, and machines, and applications to machines, machines that replace machines, that we no longer have to lift ourselves out of bed.

Of course, there’s a moral to this tale ~ a little piece of wisdom that you can apply to your own stay in the transitional zone of Veterans Campus. And that moral is: if you don’t like the roommate you got now, don’t worry. Be happy. You’ll get along just fine, sooner or later, like Davy Crockett & Paragon did ~ Paragon, that poor old rattlesnake with the negative aura so thick around him that it was downright impossible for him to see through it.
Armadillo came about because I wanted to see more review space for children's books. Barn Owl because Ann, an ex-teacher, believed passionately that good children's books went out of print all too soon in a market increasingly interested only in quick and plentiful sales. It's even worse now but none of us knew that at the time.

Twice a week she will go over to a school near our house and work with the specialist. They can increase it or decrease it, if needed. The lady who does it, is a member we know from our local pool, so that was nice seeing a friendly face. She told me I look just like Betty Draper from Mad Men. This made me laugh, and I felt the need to tell her I didn't drink or smoke while pregnant with Emily, like Betty did. This lady can be my BFF though for thinking I look like her though.
Michael helped me hold up the arches while I drilled in a few pilot holes and some dry wall screws. It's a good idea to really get those screws in flush with the MDF or even counter-sunk so you can't see them later. We installed the flat trim in the same way.

“The church she requested to attend is 180 degrees different from the ramblings of that hell, fire and brimstone preacher,” said Parnham. “She would just like to get back into a stable church whereby God and Christianity become a role in her life. There’s nothing nefarious about that.”

Mr. Requiro has soloed with the Tokyo Philharmonic, National Symphony Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, and and other orchestras across the U.S. His Carnegie Hall debut recital at Weill Hall was followed by a critically acclaimed San Francisco Performances recital at the Herbst Theatre. Soon after making his Kennedy Center debut, Mr. Requiro also completed the cycle of Beethoven’s Sonatas for Piano and Cello at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. Actively involved in contemporary music, he has collaborated with composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Bright Sheng and most recently gave the Dutch premier of Pierre Jalbert’s Sonata for cello and piano at the 2010 Amsterdam Cello Biennale.

SXSW: The roller coaster ride of SXSW is not well recorded. Lines, crowds, and an ass load of crappy bands can make you anxious. You are watching the third mediocre band of the night. You want to leave, but your friends like the band. You go to see your "can't miss pick of the night". There's a line. You wait for 15 minutes. You give up and wander. You try not to be pissed. You make a random call: "The Red Eyed Fly always has good Kharma for bands". You stop in to find the drunkest bunch of musicians you've ever seen playing the most kick ass gypsy music ever. A beer distributor gives you a free beer to "try" it. You've had it before, but pretend not to. You call your friends to come over cause "it kicks ass". Life is good.

Every day. Every single day I do this with my nemesis I75. And every single day I remember what a dumbass I am for thinking I can beat the odds, that I won't be thinking unkind thoughts about whomever caused the accident that has resulted in the bumper to bumper clusterfuck that is the worst commute in the nation. I lament the fact that they don't have formal drivers' education here, that the public transportation system is pretty much nonexistent and, of course, I berate myself for once again for forgetting that the back roads aren't just more scenic. They're more efficient, too.
Cake is always a very big party of wedding days, with that being said I've only ever eaten cake at one friends wedding and that is simply because it was forced down my throat by the groom. Odd, yes but it was a prank the Bride and Groom tried to play on myself and the bestman. I saw the prank coming a mile away and mouthed to the Bestman to "Duck!" he didn't understand and as I ducked and ran he got cake smashed in his face by the bride. The groom then chased me down and around the dance floor finally tackling me and giving me cake. Thankfully he and I are very close friends or I might have been really pissed not only at my bride/bff but at him too. Most weddings I go to I'm too busy dancing, or drinking to care about sweets, so while I was excited about planning my cake for my own wedding - I wasn't really concerned about eating it.

Southend has suffered from its reputation as a place of down-market entertainment. The fun-fair atmosphere lends credence to this, persuading the snobs that this is not a place to visit, much less to be seen in, but I think that does Southend less than justice. There is more to the place than pubs, fish and chips and games arcades. In any case, I rather think that the merry chink of money in the tills removes any concerns about what the snobs think.

Working in the tech environment that we do with creative advertising types you would expect to see a lot of iPods, digital camera’s and laptops. And you do. But I kind of always assumed that it was because of the environment. I guess with the news that Apple have managed to flog 100 million of the things in the last 5 years or so it stands to reason that you’re gonna see them out there amongst the masses :)
Not content with charging enormous up-front sums for leases on the pubs they own, the big pub chains have the nerve to then charge rent for the premises on top of that. They also dictate that the lessor "keep the standard of the pub up to their specification", so that a publican is not even allowed to decorate his own pub without their approval.
My party is a Hostess Appreciation Tea which is actually on my schedule for June. I can't wait to make the Creativity Journals with my sweet guests. We'll have hot teas, scones and quiche with a few other treats too. I enjoy this event so much each year, and I think the Journals will add to our fun.

After so many incidents in which Palestinian propaganda has managed to rearrange the narrative so that the Israeli side appears to be the aggressor, we could expect the IDF brass, as well as Israel’s government, to show restraint, perhaps count to 30, before throwing their own man under the media bus. But, alas, both IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned a senior IDF officer for the way he appears on a selectively edited Palestinian video on You Tube.

The surprising success at Prestonpans was the tinder that sparked the initial success of the Jacobite revolt in 1745: on 21 September 1745 the Jacobite army loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart and led by his son Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) defeated the government army loyal to the Hanoverian George II led by General Sir John Cope at Prestonpans – a few miles outside Edinburgh.

Noticing is what effected change for Simba in The Lion King. The voice of his father echoing from the past at last reminded him of that which he had long forgotten to pay attention to—his heart, his purpose, and his true identity. As he chose to be responsive to the truth, he was able to face his fears and return to the Pride Lands with a new perspective.
I ultimately reminded myself that all of our circumstances are different. I really know nothing about these people. Maybe their children were older and working independently when they became single moms. Maybe they didn’t start off their single parenthood with no money. Maybe they have grandparents nearby who help out. Maybe they didn’t move to a foreign country where they have no work history the year before they became single parents. Who knows. All I can focus on is where my situation is right now and how to best handle it.

I’ve been told by more than one person that I have the mouth of a sailor. Some of my favorite expletives involve a combination of the words “hairy,” “ballsack,” and “wrinkly.” This didn’t come naturally for me. I had to work at it, practice my trade, experiment with new combinations. I’ve worked very hard to have a mouth even the British Orbit lady couldn’t clean up.
During our visit Iceland was unseasonably cold. It was so cold in fact that we purchased an extra layer at Iceland's own 66˚N so we could withstand the coldness. Being on a boat only amplified that and we had to remember that this is summer.

“I have worked for 40 years, paid taxes for 40 years and paid NI for 40 years. I have been on DLA for 6 years and if I were still able to work I would still be on £40,000 pa and have a company car instead of a Motorbility car. I would travel the country using my first class rail warrant and stay in 4* hotels using my generous expense account. I had dignity, self belief, respect and I loved my job. However, it would seem that one day I decided to become disabled, poverty stricken and treated like a criminal. As a life style choice it was a disaster! Now it seems I am guilty of attempted fraud, worthless, a burden on society and a waste of space. Does anybody really believe that I prefer my life now? Drug addicts, while also needing help, are treated with more compassion and they made an informed choice to start using. I did not choose to be this way and I expect to be given as much support.” Derek Benyon, Leicestershire; sick for 7 years
I recently cancelled my cable (for the second time) due to escalating costs and a general disgust at the lack of quality programming. I won’t lie and say I’ve never indulged in reality smut for entertainment. I have caught myself watching Bachelor Pad and no part of me is proud of it. It is the “train-wreck” factor that keeps people paying attention to most of the stuff that passes for good TV.
I told by boss my leaving date this week and put the rumours to rest. Clients naturally got told first, but news travels fast with only a matter of weeks to go and soon everyone knew. condolences and wishes of good luck come flooding in, the work floods in and dries up at the same time – it is a funny one.

We had a conference with the neonatologist this afternoon and he said that her breathing issues are a result of her prematurity and she would need to stay in the NICU until she is able to breathe without assistance and keep her pulse ox in the 90s. This could take days or weeks, every baby is different.

I don’t mean to be disrespectful and I know that Mike Melvoin — who penned five tunes, including the New York songs, on the album and lends his considerable talents on piano — unfortunately passed away in February. But I can’t help feeling I’ve heard this all before. Basse is compared by some critics and the album’s publicity to Mel Torme, Ray Charles and Dr. John (Dr. John, really?) but in truth he’s a lot closer to Harry Connick, Jr. without as much sparkle and wit.

He may not always take part in our insane escapades or hang around the newsroom as much as we do, but I love Ryan too death. I know he’s all Arts and Entertainment now, but he can never forget where he started – an Assistant News Editor. There are very few people I would put money on, but Ryan is one of them. He’s not only going places, but he’s already gotten places. I’ve never seen anyone at the paper that can write a feature like this kid. He’s pretty awesome.

In itself, the tale of the publication of Into the Cannibal’s Pot: Lessons For America From Post-Apartheid South Africa bears telling. For while this polemic respects no political totems or taboos, it is faithful to facts. These facts cried out to be chronicled. They should not have had a struggle to find their way into print.
The victim’s friend, a young woman, tried to pull him back into his car. Attackers came after her, pulling her hair, punching her head and causing a bloody scratch to the surface of her eye. She called 911. A recording told her all lines were busy. She called again. Busy. On her third try, she got through and, hysterical, could scream only their location.

When I got to the park I confirmed with the ranger that there was a water fountain at the summit. I knew this would be about 11 miles and I figured I had enough water to get me up there. Once at the top, the Visitor Center, my options for getting back opened up. It felt like a safe plan, so I went for it. Halemau’u Trailhead to the Summit, then possibly back from there or a quick trip back to the car via the road that went to the summit, or, I could hitchhike down if I needed it.
We were sad to see the last course, but in a way we were so stuffed, we couldn’t have fit anymore. Unlike Kristien, I have a natural hatred of all things cheesecake, so I had a big decision to make during the whole meal. Would I eat the Marscapone Cheesecake that was served with strawberries and basil? At first I wasn’t sure, but just after the amuse bouche I knew that I trusted Chef Arik to give me something that would blow me away. Let me say, this was an amazing dessert. It was not too sweet and just right in terms of creaminess. The little ribbons of basil, too, added nice bursts of flavor to the cake. Mary paired this course with a great Muscat from Rurtherglen that wasn’t overly sweet.

Each morning when we roll out of bed we are given the world. We can make that day into anything we want just by starting the day right. I must admit, most mornings I hit snooze 10 times, each time dreading more the next time it goes off. The second that alarm goes off I flood my head with negative thoughts; 'ugg its another work day', 'I wonder what fires I will have to put out today', 'I can't wait until today is over', 'why did he break up with me?'. I'll give you one guess how my days turn out! I am a self-fulfilling prophecy. My days are slow, filled with turmoil and work problems, and I am sad and lonely. So today I tried something new! My alarm when off and I smiled. Not because I wanted to but because I needed to. I kissed my dog good morning and she bounced happily out of bed. Down the stairs we went and made some tea and scrubbed the kitchen clean. I drove to work listening to happy music, I greeted everyone with a smile, I sent out 'Good Morning!' texts. I greeted my work crew and checked in with them and I made another cup of tea. Then I opened my reader and found just what I needed to read on Elephant Journal :

It was not a brighter day in Nassau. It rained the entire trip but we were going on the island this time. You can’t let a little rain ruin your vacation. It is all about how you make your experience. We even made fashionable rain outfits out of trash bags! Some of us had on dresses, cardigans, and coats made out of a plastic bag. It was hilarious and we dressed it up with accessories like belts. When we got off the ship we ran to the island, which we didn’t need to do because there were shuttles taking us from the ship to the entrance of the island. We got wet for nothing but we kept pressing on.
Before the Lord ever brought Caleb, my husband, into my life, it was my desire to find ways, as a single girl, that I could be a blessing to a future husband that I didn't know yet. I sought to find ways that I could be a Proverbs 31 wife, bringing her husband good all the days of her life, and during this time, I made a list of some applicable things I could do for my future husband that would act as blessing.

The other thing I love about this is that I don’t have to start out all kinds of wonderful. God seems to be very generous when it comes to handing me seeds to plant. It’s good, because new gardeners and farmers make mistakes in their planting. Planting or sowing isn’t merely a matter of throwing handfuls of seeds onto the ground and hoping for the best. Some seeds must be planted deeper than others. Some need more space while some are good with crowding. Some need more water or more sun or more acid or more alkalinity. The production of a really beautiful, vibrant, fruitful harvest will probably be the end result of lots of mistakes and failures as the new gardener learns and becomes an experienced gardener. The gardener who achieves fruitfulness will be the one who persevered. “Doing good” seems much the same.

I had a meeting yesterday with the team at Simon & Schuster, along with my agent Luigi Bonomi. They detailed the global campaign planned for COVENANT, and it is utterly awesome. I learned a huge amount about how the campaign is designed to produce 'tail-off', maintaining a book's prominent placing on the shelves, along with all sorts of details involving the television adverts, posters, on-line and supermarket promotions. The list was immense, and apparently regarded as one of the biggest and best debut launch campaigns ever seen ( in Australia ).
I created formats for my comics, books, CD’s, DVD’s…even my video games. I’d like to talk about the books.xml file I put together, and how it’s changed across 7 years.
And suddenly, I was a multi-tasker. My MamaEar was attuned to the cry of my kids. And it was good. To everyone but the adult trying to talk to me. But I figured, the adult could deal. The baby and the toddler had to be attended to. Or a ruckus would be raised, in my honor. And frankly, while I appreciated the effort involved, I could do without the ruckus. Who needs one more ruckus?

Look closely, though, and the belief in a 2012 apocalypse has a great deal in common with the belief that asset prices can have an infinite upside. Both beliefs offer grand narratives that replace the ordinary patterns of human existence with a something-for-nothing fantasy. The bubble believers insist that they can have limitless wealth without having to work for it; the 2012 believers insist that they can have the new and improved world they think they want—whether that amounts to a new age of enlightenment, on the one hand, or a Hollywood movie world of heroic survivors blazing away against hordes of roving zombies, on the other—without having to work for it. In either case, what drives the fantasy is the conviction that it makes sense to sit on your backside and wait for the market, or the space brothers, or something else to give you the future you think you deserve.
The main problem with appealing to epicycles & deferents is that while it may explain features like retrograde motion and make reasonably accurate predictions (such as the old Ptolemaic model), it isn’t consistent with other celestial observations, such as…

Dundrum Town Centre was opened in 2005 having been built by Anglo “Golden Circle” member Joe O’Reilly and fellow Longford man, the late Liam Maye. The site was reportedly bought for €10.2m. With 79,000 sq metres it claims to be the biggest shopping centre in the State. It is reported to contribute some €7m per annum in local authority rates to DunLaoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The Irish Times claims that the centre had a footfall of 19m, that is 19m visitors, last year and further claims “a great many of them from the affluent south Dublin suburbs”. Phase II of the centre has been given the green light by planning authorities but its future is in doubt against the backdrop of the economic crisis – Phase II was to have been a €600m development which would have seen 101,000 sq metres of space added making the shopping centre the largest in Europe.

In the mean time, I decided to start keeping track of just what words Goldie can say. I started yesterday counting only spoken words, no matter how hard they were to understand. I was blown away that she used 87 different words!! I had no idea she was using that many. Today we weren't as diligent, but I noticed a bunch of words that she didn't say yesterday, so tomorrow we are going to keep track again. I also think its important that most of these were said without prompting. She either initiated the conversation or repeated them after I used them in a sentence. Goldie is not a "performer" so the best way to know where she is developmentally is to watch and interact with her during normal family routines.
I'm getting off topic here. I'm starting to rant and rave a little.

As of January 1st. 2011 every cab will run on meters. The meters will be paid for by the owners of the company, the meters will be purchased from a distributor to be named by the city. Every cab will run the same model of meter and will be calibrated by the distributor every 6 months. The cost of calibration will be covered by the owner/broker of the cab.
Hubby and I have never been to one of the celebrations, but so many people visit that there would be no place to park, and no way to get near the elephant enclosure anyway.

The connection between the title & the story only surfaces after you are about 80% into the book, leaving me very non-motivated to even read further to find out what the iron tooth is about in the first place. Even when I did find out what the iron tooth is about, & how it helps the story move further, it’s too late, since the author by then had successfully bored me.
This association is like Summer in a mouthful, if Summer were to decide she got a little tired of eating salad and drinking water all day long. This is the part when Summer gets fun.
Naturally the move has taken a lot of time, Thursday and Friday last week were busy days regarding this. However, my time was not all spend humping furniture a fifty five years of collected items, on Saturday, along with Liz Hazell, our Walsall UKIP branch treasurer and Albert and Graham Duffen from Birmingham, I drove up to Skegness for the UKIP Spring Conference – which to say the least was a very uplifting day – UKIP is really on the march now and becoming a real threat to the other, longer established but totally failed, political parties.

How are you affected by the size of the room you’re in?
Over the past year or so, I've been in a lot of boutiques that are a little new to me. A big reason for that has been location--Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Paris offer some great stores. But I knew what I wanted to look at long before I walked in. In Burberry, I wanted to find THE trench, and I did. How? I walked in, I started looking around, I got approached, and I accepted the offer of help. I told the sales assistant that I was only looking (I said this first off), but I felt it time to think about investing in a trench (given I've been considering this for ten years, my sense of time clearly is fluid). The ensuing discussion and try-ons were about fitting me. That's it. I took the information on the sales assistant's card. When I decide to purchase it, he's who I call. It was all professionally handled--my end, his end. In other words, it wasn't about the cupid's singing--it was about finding information.
In 1950, the remains of Wingate and his nine companions were disinterred from their grave in India. With his family’s agreement, Wingate was taken to what US Military personnel hold to be sacred ground. On the old plantation of confederate General Robert E. Lee, in what is now Arlington National Cemetery, Orde Charles Wingate was laid to rest with full military honors. The fact that this was done at a time when the United States was occupied by the expansion of communism in Asia and a frightening face off with Soviet forces in Europe speaks volumes about how highly the United States Military regarded Orde Wingate.
As a result, it was immensely refreshing for me to read the below article by Aadil Palkhivala, an Ayurvedic practitioner who is widely regarded as one of the world’s top yoga teachers. Things that particularly resonated with me are his simple yet powerful statements like ‘There is no perfect diet, and no ideal food. I encourage you to monitor your food intake to determine what works for you and what doesn’t—diet has to be adjusted individually’. Good common sense in many respects, and principles that are easy to follow and live by. I look forward to reading much more from this wise man!

So God suffers, in other words we suffer, especially our most male component that tries to do good. In other words we believe that any really good men will need to suffer to the point of dying, which in turn will make accompanying good women suffer accordingly, which in turn will make it even harder for people not particularly good at life to catch a break, and since it will be done unto us as we believe, no wonder we can’t seem to stop killing each other incessantly for even two minutes at any given point in time. No wonder we keep ourselves perpetually too lazy to clean up after our own filth, or toss a can in a recycling bin. No wonder those of us who believe that God is greater than the consciousness of a suffering person constantly have to work harder after those who insist on worshipping suffering itself as though it is their own God; as if it is themselves. Since it shall be done unto us as we believe, or at least so says that guy supposedly, can we stop believing in a suffering God now and start believing in a happy one? It seems to be what Jesus would have wanted for us; to believe in a happy God. Or would anyone rather believe in a God that wants us to suffer?
I feel more comfortable walking along the shore (a more open, spacious feeling). When I am walking the trails in the wooded parks, it feels more closed in and secluded and I'm not comfortable walking alone.

Jim discloses that he was looking at a wall comprised of hundreds upon hundreds of infant bodies, all wrapped in Buddhist ceremonial fabrics, stacked one upon another. Again, Garrow provides no clues with which to test the veracity of this statement, and its purpose seems designed to re-enforce the Western view that the Chinese kill their unwanted daughter's wholesale, against all verifiable evidence to the contrary.

Oh and before I forget, our special sister, Deb’, well she requested we ordered her a new sim card, she wanted to make sure her soon to be ex-husband couldn’t text or ring her so that was organised, although ironically, whilst standing in the O2 shop, he rang and we hung up on him 3 times within a matter of minutes before removing the battery and sim card and oops he can’t contact her again on there, whoopee.

Iran armed their first wave of missiles with EMP warheads designed to unleash a devastating shockwave that destroyed all electronics as soon as they were shot down by the missile defense system.

In other news, yesterday, our friend Amy decided, for her birthday, to conduct a full, costumed, drunken enactment of "Annie," held at a local theater (off hours). I'd say there were about 50 people there plus a bunch of kids. Many were costumed (myself included,) many were drunk on gin and tonics at 10 in the morning (ditto). Sadly, my camera decided to die yesterday morning, so there are no extant photographs of me in my Miss Hannigan outfit. Damn. There was a wig involved, and a red bra, and Mardi Gras beads, and a flask. (Oh, and fair warning to all of you - should you ever find yourself in a situation in which you are expected to perform a largely impromptu 30's period piece musical with many of your friends, DO NOT listen to your significant other if he or she suggests that it would be a good idea to put REAL gin in your prop flask, as that would be "method acting." This, as it turns out, is a BAD IDEA.)

The man at the Auto-Body-Repair Shop said he'd lend me a courtesy car, and so he did. It was quite a nice car in some ways, apart from the rattles, the rust and the black smoke, but it was very small and had a ridiculously low bucket seat, the type that has a 6 inch ledge all round your thighs. With great difficulty I managed to manouevre myself into this ground-level driving seat, with my legs sticking horizontally forward into the well. I drove off, noticing as I did so that the car wouldn't go into second gear, and shortly afterwards, that the petrol gauge registered zero.
This view clearly has much wider significance. That it is at the edges of practically any sphere, from science to society, that diversity and innovation can be found. If you want to know what the next interesting thing will be, look to the edges of society where ideas clash and fuse. Permaculture itself has been pretty marginal for years – as has the eco-movement. Hippies have been quietly living in woods, harvesting water and composting poo for a long time – it is only now that those ideas are gaining weight in the mainstream.
In other words, the use of mantras are not God pleasing. God does not want anyone approaching Him in a senseless manner. He wants us to rightfully use the mind He created for us. To approach the most holy LORD of all, without using the gift of our full senses is an abomination and a gross sign of disrespect. It’s being silly — and we are not to act silly before God Almighty. That is sinful.
So, yesterday was my one year blogging anniversary! I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't even notice until late last night, by which time it was too late to get out the candles or whip up a cake.

Luckily, there is one male LPN on duty tonight to share the task. So I do what I am trained to do. I step up on that step stool and position my clasped hands just above the tip of the sternum. Whatever sleepiness that had settled in during my uneventful evening was now flushed away with a sea of adrenaline. I begin to throw all my weight into compressing this man's rib cage as I repeatedly check his pulse rate on the monitor. Too slow or too shallow and I'm not circulating enough blood.

My “Cornish” daughter was still in evidence today – this one may run and run. She laughs with us about it and to hear a nearly 8-year old answer everything with “…my lover” in a broad accent is funny.
The neighbor’s wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband’s mouth on the woman’s mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.

The housing payout shock comes after the hook-handed cleric won the right to keep his British ­citizenship. That victory raised fears he will be successful in his fight to avoid extradition to the US to face terror ­charges.
Well… It all started when I had a summer class with a group of High School girls. They kept talking about these dramas… How cute the men were .. How pretty the girls were… how they cried and laughed and just fell in love with every character. I thought awww… isn’t that cute. Their little obsession ..aww to be a teenager again. I figured I needed to stay hip and on top of the latest fads.. being a teacher… so I had better watch one so I can identify with my teenage girl students….Then OMG…I was hooked. Oh… they are like .. extended versions of our afterschool specials but with a little more humor and action.

Note that we plotted WKU first, followed by other member Sun Belt institutions. After that, the remaining Kentucky schools went on. Beyond that, I left it up to my son to ask questions and pick states until the session ended. This morning, he rolled out of bed, and his first words to me were, “What about Rhode Island?” So, we put URI’s baby blue and Providence’s black on the map before breakfast.

7. Some people will argue that Columbus Day is a day for recognition of Italians, an Italian Pride Day. Are Italians more worthy of recognitionthan other ethnic groups in this country we have proudly (?) nicknamed"The Melting Pot"? I have heard Italians say that Germans have Oktoberfest, the Irish have St. Patrick's Day and Mexicans have Cinco deMayo, but none of those are FEDERAL holidays. The only two ethnic groups worthy of recognition for their contributions and sacrifice in this land are those who were ALREADY HERE when the Europeans came and those who the Europeans BROUGHT HERE IN CHAINS. All other ethnic groups came here voluntarily. It was long overdue but African Americans finally got their holiday - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in January.... but Native Americans still don't have a holiday (urge your congressmen and women to support House Bill #167).

I quickly feel the unmistakeable snapping of ribs. My instant reaction is to let off the pressure but I know what has to be done. I continue to pound away while the doctor and nurses scramble with heart stimulating drugs and paddle shocks.

1995 – 2000: Around this time I developed asthma. I suppose that’s what all those bronchitis bouts were leading up to. Don’t worry. If you get this, the medications are very good now and you won’t be left like Che Guevara – alone and infirm in a tent, breathing into an empty, paper bag.

Audi’s Q3 is an interesting proposition. It’s aimed squarely at the BMW X1 and offers decent performance from a range of small petrol and diesel engines. Combining sporty premium SUV features in a compact body, the Q3 range starts at R370,000. It looks a little ordinary but its strength will be in ride, road holding and luxury interior. In a move that is most unlike Audi, there are some really funky colours available for the Q3. Google “Samoa Orange” if you don’t believe me.
I also purchased various dried herbs- these are often served on a Greek salad and mixes for making authentic tzatziki. And of course some real Feta cheese. Rich and creamy, salty, moist and slightly sour, semi-solid and certainly not hard and tasteless like you often find here.
As if these were not enough of a reason for both to remember the fixture, Alan Ball broke his leg by, in his own words, sitting on it. That injury kept the England midfielder out of his country’s end of season tour; the FA had to do something given England’s failure to qualify for the World Cup finals in West Germany that summer.
Handwriting: Part of the writing process is the ability to put words on paper. I know. Seems kinda obvious, right? But I've known a lot of parents (*points to self*) who expect their kids to journal and create and express their loving hearts out on paper before this skill has taken root. For some kids, the fine motor control just isn't there until age eight or so. Until then, don't feel like you're "cheating" if your child is verbalizing answers and sentences while you write them down.

Meanwhile, Greene was acting her heart out, doing the best she could with the character of a burned-out, child-like brown-acid-victim, who hysterically confesses to crimes she hasn’t committed in order to pad out the plot… but her refusal to burst into song, or call upon the “Pie Hole” gang to help solve the case definitely counts against her here. It was kinda cool to see her dressed as a hippie-ish “rock chick” though… more of that, please! Martin just seemed to be irritated by everyone and everything she encountered… presumably because she knows she’s the heroine of a murder mystery story, who can’t actually solve murder mysteries. That must be quite frustrating for her. Siemaszko was mostly there to react to exposition, but she managed to keep things fairly lively, so a tip of the hat to her for that… and I enjoyed Tina Lifford’s turn as ‘Bonnie’, the kindly owner of the B&B where the main characters take their regular coffee breaks. Other than that, everything was pretty yawn-worthy…

Although there is beautiful scenery, “Treasure Island” takes an unflinching look at the hardships of the seafaring life and features genuine tension. After the camp silliness of “Pirates of the Caribbean,” the authenticity is refreshing. As for all the stabbing and the like, well, as Long John Silver says, without violence or the threat of it, “other men take what’s yours and they live the life that should be yours.”

I also have no idea what she's eating, how much she's exercising, what she's learning, how she's learning, whether she's tidying up after herself, whether she's minding her manners, how she's spending her money, what music she's listening to, how much TV she's watching, whether she's brushing her teeth and wearing her retainers, and so on and so on. I don't ask, she doesn't offer, I just don't know.

I slammed on my brakes and surveyed the scene. I could hardly breathe and was momentarily overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of those few seconds. As a neighbor and Mr. Dorsey rushed to Michael’s aid I turned around and rode as fast as I could to his house, back up the hill on Rittenhouse and a right turn onto 48th Avenue. A block later as I turned left, onto our street, I passed Michael’s five-year old sister Sandy at the corner and shouted to her as I passed, “Michael’s been hit by a car!” Climbing the stairs to their front porch I pounded on the open screen door and shouted inside repeating to his parents what I had just told Sandy moments before. His dad rushed out the door and leaped from their porch yelling frantically “Where? Where?” I said “Down the hill on Rittenhouse Street!” I struggled on my bike to keep up with Michael’s father as he ran like a racehorse to his son’s side. Michael’s mother arrived soon behind as I watched from a short distance away.

The richness of the soup does creep up on you, and despite my confidence I could eat the entire bowl easily, I find I'm the victim of an embarrassing defeat. And I very rarely don't finish my meal.
We lost touch after that as we were living very different lives. One day as I was bravely pushing a double pram up a hill in my local shopping centre, his mother walked by. She stopped to chat and I proudly showed off my two babies. I asked how my ex was doing and she told me that he was about to be married for the second time, and that he had recovered from ‘his breakdown’. Immediately I remembered the shaking hands and the lost look in his eye. So the past had caught up with him after all.

Another big deal today, for me personally this time, was the arrival of my brand new birth certificate!! I've been waiting very (im)patiently for this since about July, I believe, and it's finally here!!! This completes all the really big personal information changes. Finally! I still have to take care of changing my name on my mortgage, as that's a bit of a hassle. But I'm going to get that done really soon now, as I believe I've found the documents I need to do this. I'm just about done with seeing that old name on any mail....

The first time I saw the end of Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Eclisse I felt I had been caught off guard, disoriented. The film ends with a string of desolate shots without any narrative progression, shown one after another. For most of the film we had been following the drama of the central characters. Suddenly, for the last seven minutes, the characters we have come to know have disappeared — and yet the film continues. We see deserted streets, shadows, anonymous strangers. Without the characters to ground us in story, the presence of the camera itself seems stronger. We become aware of it as an apparatus, a seeing-device that acts as its own separate entity. There is camera movement (panning, following a figure walking on a street) which suggests that something is about to be revealed; it seems Antonioni is trying to tell us something. There are some wide, long takes from above that slowly pan around as if surveying the streets. Trees rustle in the wind. A man in a suit rounds a corner. A toddler looks up at his mother. A close up of a man’s earlobe. A stream of water flows into the gutter. “Yes, what is it Antonioni?” I remember thinking, “What are you trying to show us?” I was searching for meaning, for story. A streetlamp burns brightly. The music crescendos. The film is over. There is an elegance to this sequence that I cannot quite explain.

So after all this time, I'm still here at a day shy of 38 weeks. Baby has moved head down and into birth position (though is not well engaged in the pelvis yet), and is healthy as can be or so say the tests. The last growth scan indicated a 7+ pound infant and my new doctor cheerfully informed me that if I go to 40 weeks, we may have a 9-pounder on our hands. I did not find that amusing.
Use any size cutter you want, but make sure to pack them in your pan tightly and let them rise a long time, until they are doubled. I let mine rise for hours in an oven that I preheated to 250 F and then shut off. These biscuits are not quick to make, for sure! Howeverm the dough can be made a head and refrigerated for up to a week for even better flavor.

They've never really done one before and I have to say, this one was quite a doozy! Our backyard is right at the tee box of a golf course, so they sat in our yard and caught all the golfers passing. At 25 cents a cup (and they sold some cookies for 50 cents each) $15 total is not a bad profit! They were stoked. And wanted to do it again the next day. I told them they couldn't or the city might shut them down for making too much money. :)
He could also see Tanner, his German Shepard, still asleep on his pillow over next the couch, probably because the damn dog was as drunk as he was from drinking beer last night. The dog had the strange habit of watching tourists and when one would leave the table he or she was sitting at, quickly run up, knock the bottle to the floor, and begin lapping of the spilled liquid. It was a trick Jack and other locals enjoyed since Tanner had the uncanny ability to target the most obnoxious person of whatever tourist group happened to be visiting at that time, usually a white, middle-aged American male.
What do you do for fun (I.e. Hobbies, leisure time, etc.)
I suspect the days in June were very rare for me indeed, as they seem to pass as if in slow motion. Too hot weather, too early at times, and then the perfect summer days that one wants never to end. And then there is the intensity of July! Is there enough iced-tea? Are the white shirts cool enough? Are the plants on the terrace getting enough water? July seems to ask a lot of us. Even getting to vacation locations has its imperatives.

With a career total of more than 100 films, Bette changed the way Hollywood looked at actresses. In 1977, she was the first woman to be honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also the first woman to be president of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. At the age of 75, Bette had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. Nine days later, she suffered a stroke. Despite her failing health, she continued to act until her death. Bette passed away October 6, 1989 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.

60,000 - The number of people in Zimbabwe now infected by cholera, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Cholera has now claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people in Zimbabwe. The epidemic of the disease, has been fueled by the collapse of Zimbabwe’s water, sanitation and health systems. Many hospitals have shut down and most towns suffer from poor water supply, broken sewers and uncollected waste. With the upcoming rainy season even more infections could occur as water sources become contaminated.

Fast-forward to December. By the time I'm on my way to work, the sun has barely risen, and chances are I'm trudging through rain, slush, or usually a mix of both.

Well, it's empty and filled with remnants of fall leaves, making the ground slippery and forcing anyone to look at their feet rather than at the sky.

Make Real Estate Work for the City – especially in the cases of cities like Baltimore and Detroit which have declined from larger populations, there is a huge untapped potential in the vacant housing and real estate for economic development. First, rehabilitation of vacant housing and real estate can be the foundation for a direct job creation program with extremely valuable production. Second, selling that housing cheaply (in the case of Baltimore for a dollar) or just giving it away to working people literally spreads the wealth while expanding the city’s tax base. As occupancy rates in these properties rise, so does the value of housing and land the city owns – building up the Metropolitan Reserve Banks in turn. Third, it can provide a real solution for homelessness by just giving people a key to an apartment and access to facilities.

Yard work isn’t all that Greg has been up to lately; he’s also been keeping up with his freshwater tanks. We got rid of the saltwater a while back, but we’ve still got the other two. He completely re-did the smaller one this past weekend because it had an algae problem. He put new substrate in the bottom, bought new plants, washed out the tank completely, and even gave the fish some new decorations. He’s also ordered a new bulb to help with the plants and algae. We’re hoping the new additions/upgrades keep the algae in check because the tank is looking great at the moment.
So I've made the move across the country - I actually made the move in June, but I wouldn't say that I've really settled in until now. I've got a job, I just moved into a new apartment in Portland, and I really feel like I'm beginning my life out here.

Families often ask me how i can get their child to do something they can't.. well i have limited emotional investment ( not MY child) and i listen and observe the behavior so i understand the communication. If you react rather than respond you are liable to misunderstand and the behavior continues. We need to be the problem solvers we want our children to grow up to be. They need to test the rules, we need to set them. It is our job as parents to be completely present all the time, ( which is not always doable). It is necessary to be all Parent and only some person when the children are under 5. I tell parents that there is a big P and a little t in parent... we must embrace that big P in order for the adult child to walk away from us at 18 or 20 and be independent and ultimately successful.

The Good: A must read. Stassen accomplishes much with few pages (less than 80!) and few words. He tells of life before and after the Genocide; he includes the various factions and entities present, from the UN peacekeeping force to the Rwandan Patriotic Front to the Interahamwe. The brevity helps; too many words would drown this story. The simplicity emphasizes the horror.

Hyun Suk confronts M2 with the video. They all wonder how it got there and Hyun Suk asks if they’re the ones in the video. Jae Ha is about to stand but Seung Yeon stops him. Team Leader Han takes them to task and Hyun Sung speaks up-it was them. Chang Min tells him to be specific-as in who was and who wasn’t there. Hyun Suk is shrewd and asks Chang Min what he wants to say but Jae Ha speaks up, wanting to take responsibility. Chang Min scoffs at him and Hyun Suk sees it. The team sits outside later-minus Jae Ha wondering who took the video and Tae Gun rightly points out-anyone could’ve taken the movie but not everyone could have delivered it to Hyun Suk with a look at Chang Min. Chang Min owns up to it. They wonder how he could betray the team and if he had that little confidence in himself. Chang Min scoffs, at least he’s not lying like someone else, with a look at Seung Yeon! In Hyun Suk’s office, Hyun Suk asks to hear the reason Jae Ha went on stage without the company’s permission. Did he go to earn money or he wanted to show the world his talent? Jae Ha tells them he needed the money so he took the gig and everyone just helped him. Hyun Suk asks, is it for the same reason you go out with your guitar every night? Team Leader Han is stunned. Jae Ha has a part time gig and Hyun Suk knew it? At Jae Ha’s response, Hyun Suk smiles and tells him it’s good he’s honest and confident. Meanwhile, Woo Hyun is on his way back to the company from the airport. Everyone’s still pissed at Jae Ha who comes back and tells them it’ll be fine, he’ll take the blame. Seung Yeon tells Chang Min he shouldn’t have betrayed the team like this and he rounds back at her, however anyone else says things, she has no right to condemn him. He asks her if she thinks she has the right to be on the team and turns to Ji Woo too who tries to defend Seung Yeon. Before a fight breaks out, Team Leader Han walks in.

The way out of impossibilities is to fully realize that it is an illusion, perpetuated by our own attachment to an erroneous perception of reality. When we notice we are feeling mired and stuck, we can challenge the impossibilities by asking our self: “Is it true that I am not loved?” When we are open, ready and willing to release attachments to the impossibilities, the answer becomes: “No! The very essence of life itself is love. And I am of life. I am of Nature. I too am the stuff that is Nature. I am connected to everything, everywhere, always. I am love!”

It is something I want to talk about, as I had a conversation about it today, and I’ve had a lot of really interesting conversations about it in the past. And especially because I don’t really know what I think of it.
Parents were invited again, and I put in a brief appearance with Possum. We didn't stay long because Mousie seemed to think she had to sit with us, but we could see she wanted to join in with the dancing that was going on over at the other side of the room. I knew we made the right decision when we looked back through the window and saw her happily doing the conga with her friends.
Today in German-speaking Europe many families set up an Advent wreath, or Adventskranz on the first Advent Sunday (the fourth before Christmas) to start off the Advent season. The picture on the left shows a typical evergreen Advent wreath with its four candles, one for each week of Advent. Traditional families gather around the wreath on each Advent Sunday to light the next candle and sing Christmas carols. This was even more important in the past, when the Christmas tree was usually reserved for a special unveiling only on Christmas Eve. Until then, the Advent wreath provided the evergreen look and aroma in the house.

We crossed the Stari Most to Coppersmiths’ Street (Kujundziluk). Lined with vendors selling souvenirs made by local artists and coppersmiths, many items portrayed the Old Bridge. We visited several of the little shops. One of the coppersmiths we spoke with asked where we were from and then proudly told us he had a daughter who lives in the United States.We bought a few souvenirs for ourselves and family (later, we would see all the same kinds of souvenirs in Istanbul (read about the trip here).

After having a rough arrival to Melbourne, with housing drama, I was very excited to take a few days from the apartment search and relax in true Aussie fashion on the beach. I made my trek to the university a whopping 9 kilometer walk to campus (just another incentive to find a new place to live). I made some fast friends waiting for the trip leaders to organize the buses and we set off for an adventure on the Great Ocean Road.
I know I haven't been around much. Preoccupied. You see, in just two weeks from today I'll be driving back to the place I spent four of the best years of my life. Oddly enough, I haven't been back since.
That is the crown of it that means those who are thinking that maybe one day I will grow less, they are wasting their time.
Of course, these were two separate photos--from two different homes. I didn't think I'd ever find a blacktop driveway that led to a brick house--a house with dormers and lots of trees.
With the cooling weather I've sought to make some comfort food - a simple borlotti bean ragu. At its heart is a soffritto - onion, celery, carrot - to which I've added red capsicum and grated zucchini. Red capsicum when slowly cooked adds a lovely sweetness to the dish and grated zucchini thickens the sauce and makes it almost creamy.

Like communism or socialism, capitalism is a word with objective, specific meaning. The French word “laissez-faire” literally means “let us alone.” According to Ayn Rand, the greatest contemporary philosopher who offered the best defense of this most moral economic system, capitalism simply means “a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.” Sison is right in saying that capitalism is about greed and self-interest. This is because the moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist claim that it represents the best way to achieve the common good. Under a true capitalist system, the achievement of common good is merely a secondary consequence.

We used to say that we would struggle, fight, and wage Jihad, until we regain our rights, because what was taken by force will only be restored by force, and what was taken by the sword will not be restored by the pen or the word. Unfortunately, however, we have abandoned this, and we have taken the path of the so-called “peaceful solution.” We have made one concession after another.

What made me so sorrowful? It was pointed out to me that my heart is not perfect and the truth of it makes me mourn. It’s what I want MORE THAN ANYTHING and it cuts cruel and deep, “Father, please cover my imperfect heart with your breastplate of righteousness”. Can I bear the Kings armor till he purifies my heart?
My husband will add some things from time to time and I will always seek God and my husband’s approval before posting anything here. I want to make sure it is from God and not my flesh. Now I know why God has been stressing only posting His Word – Truth and to be prepared.

On the way home from our favourite farm on Tuesday we stopped off for a wander around a small town. In a shop window were a row of Queenie's, all slowly waving with glazed expressions. Being suckers for plastic stuff that does nothing more than make us laugh meant we needed one so we rushed in to bag our own Queenie. Now she sits on our windowsill watching and waving while we do kitchen stuff. Our favourite plastic friend was a chubby grinning chinese boy who sat astride a pink dolphin and spun from the ceiling playing plinky music. He fell to pieces a long while back now and I still miss him.

Of course, if they were forced to read "Guns, Germs, and Steel," there would be a hell of a lot more suicide bombers than there are now. Jeez, that book did go on. I thought a better name for it would have been "Location, Location, Location: and what they ate while they were there," but I guess that title is not as catchy. There were not enough guns or germs, and steel barely got a mention. What did get mentioned, repeatedly, was the phrase "food production," approximately 1,296,379 times. McDonald's does not talk about food production that much, for Christ's sake. Then again, McDonald's doesn't serve food, so maybe that's why.

27. Evangelista - In Animal Tongue
Homosexuals have chosen the word “gay,” a word that means “happy” or “a lively, merry mood” or “bright, showy,” to describe their lifestyle. In homosexuality’s portrayal in the media and in its publicity by its advocates, that’s what it can appear to be. A fun-loving, free lifestyle. Yet this is only a mirage. Over the years, in every interaction I have had with a person calling their lifestyle “gay,” that same angry fire that my bookstore acquaintance had could be seen in their eyes . Whether it’s been a one-time opportunity to interact with someone who has identified himself as gay or the longer-term weekly counseling of a man who claimed hundreds of partners (and looked as if it were true), a below-the-surface, seething anger has always been present.

I would definitely like to know more about it.

The connection between us it seems
Once I was here I needed to taka a taxi to the confernce center. I had google mapped it, and it was about a 5 minute drive. So I gave the address to the driver, who seemed to know wehre it was but then proceeded to get lost and drive around for about 30 minutes looking for it. It turned into a very expensive taxi ride. I paid it, but I wish now I'd been a bit more assertive about saying that I shouldn't have been charged so much.
Once Isaac is released from the gurney he's been strapped to, he's forced to flee the ward as Necromorphs jump out from around corners and burst through ducts. Cue the frantic escape sequence. But here's the fun part: he's still tied up in a straight jacket. A prompt instructs us to hold down the left shoulder button to run. The straight jacket conceit makes this particular piece of scaffolding feel natural while also playing on that horror movie trope, the powerless protagonist.
So...the next time you look at those wonderful fall leaves or pick up a bright red maple leaf or wonder at the beauty of a yellow hickory leaf - remember how those wonderful colors were produced - and realize how magical a plant really is to the planet. Not because of the colors of the leaves or how it looks in our landscape, but how it keeps us alive by producing all of that sugar and oxygen that keeps us eating and breathing every day.
Wait wait wait... what does Star Wars have to do with any of this? Apparently, no movie like Meteor is going to admit wanting to jump on the same bandwagon as George Lucas and company, but it would be idiotic of it not to think that any geek high off of the adventures of a galaxy far far away wouldn't want to keep the intergalactic ball rolling by signing up for an adventure that involves NASA, rockets, desperate scientists and the fate of mankind. Maybe Neame and his crew thought that Meteor was the anti-Star Wars; science fiction for the thinking set.
The less you can explain the questions of your purpose and existence the more you come up with a ridiculous analysis for life and your left with no reason for existing or for life at all. The cycle continues. The more hateful against anything good and morally right you get. The more you hate those stupid Christians that claim God exists and that say there is a reason and purpose for your life .
During most races we see the mechanics make adjustments to the car during pitstops. During each stint radio communications between the driver and his race engineer will discuss the cars balance. Whether the car tends to oversteer or understeer. Since the ban on active technologies there’s little the teams can do to alter the car during the race. Currently only front wing adjustment, rear wing gurney removal and tyre pressures are easily changed during the hectic 3-4s pitstops.

What I wanted at TBEX was a session that presented the reality of writing as a profession, not as a quixotic pursuit or a weekend hobby or gap year boondoggle. Admittedly, I wanted this for myself as much as anything. Because I struggle with what I do (what is that, anyways?) all the time. I wanted to hear people who I think of as grown up, professional travel writers speak honestly about how they juggle all this stuff, how they manage to make it work. I’m always grateful for time with writers who will share, honestly, how they get by — a recent conversation revealed a writer’s need to sell multiple stories about one destination with every trip in order to make the travel pay off. “I can’t go just because I want to. I need to sell that story five times over to have it be worth my while.”
Both babies measured great - he's 1lb, 2oz and she's 15.9oz, which puts them right about at the 50th percentile. They had good fluid levels, solid heartbeats, and my bleed has officially absorbed!! YAHOOOO!!! I go back in 4 weeks and we'll tour the maternity ward and NICU then. I was so overwhelmed with joy that they looked so awesome! My mom came with me to the u/s and she loved every minute of it - it truly is so special to see them.

In the United Kingdom after days of obfuscation and half-denials the Prime Minister admits he did ride a horse loaned to a tabloid news editor he was friendly with by the police force that was investigating her newspaper.
I wanted to go with a vintage theme for Mum. Not saying she is old though! Just wanted something a bit nostalgic. It also took me out of my own comfort zone, as I don't normally do vintage! I loved using the Hat Pin (retired), and I have also used the Velvet Ribbon available in the new Summer Mini Catalogue. I didn't want cream though and dyed this ribbon, using my Night of Navy ink pad. I was surprised how beautifully this ribbon dyed up! Not at all patchy as I thought it would.
I know from my own experience that my horse (who currently schools Fourth Level and some of the Prix St. George) cannot school in the arena more than three days per week. (And he’ll tell you if you ask!) So to keep him fresh, interested, and fit, we spend the three days hacking out, doing trot and canter sets in the lanes, or long-lining, another three days doing a more traditional schooling routine, and then he gets one day off per week. And I generally find that I get my best, show-quality work from him on the day after he’s either rested or hacked – particularly if we struggled with a problem or issue in our last training session prior to the rest day. It’s like the time away has shown him what he needs to do to get it right (and me too!), so with a little bit of cogitation and fresh muscles, it’s all right there.
Article 8 does not always work though. A paedophile illegal immigrant, Zulfar Hussain, has finally been thrown out of Britain after a long court battle in which he claimed that his deportation would breach his human rights. This is good news, but Hussain represents only a drop in the multicultural ocean and cost the taxpayer over £100,000 in his welfare funded legal battle to remain in Blackburn, Lancashire.
So our unique perceptions of the world we experienced together were destined to be endlessly different, destined to be unrelated. And no matter what I said to her, she would never understand that what I write on these pages, when I say that I have no home and that I am endlessly tormented by the constant need to leave everything behind and travel, to give up the entire world I’ve created and move on to something new, that this isn’t in any way a sad thing in my eyes.

Here comes another rant from me, THE CHILDLESS MOMMY BLOGGER, as I’ve taken to calling myself. You know, I think (much like Oprah – another childless mommy advisor) that the hardest thing you can do is raise a kid. And even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more a**hole. This is of such monumental importance in my opinion, that it does, indeed, take a village. So, I’m here to help. As I was working up some research this morning, I came across some parenting ideas / actions/ products that I feel could lead your child astray. I am here to try and stop you…or rather stop the ridiculous human being who would subject their child to any of the below.

Straight away, one has to think about Mycoplasma pneumonia. People at highest risk for mycoplasma pneumonia include those living or working in crowded areas such as schools, Army barracks and homeless shelters. The incubation time for Mycoplasma pneumonia is one to 4 weeks. This means that it takes one to 4 weeks after catching the bug to become ill. A bit like with chickenpox, which has an incubation time of one to 3 weeks.

Lancôme had offered the lower court an expert report of a physical-chemical analysis of the two perfumes. The report concluded that, given the fact that there are hundreds of different components that could have been used, it is highly unlikely that it is a coincidence that Kecofa used 24 of the exact components out of the 26 in total used by Lancôme. The 25th ingredient was a cheaper substitute of the remaining Trésor component. Since the expertise of the report was not denied by Kecofa, nor the accusation of copying, the Court concluded that Kecofa must have copied Lancôme’s product and therefore violated Lancôme’s copyrights.

My cough has become a part of who I am. My roommates know when I get home because they hear me coughing when I walk through the door. It tells them.... "HONEY I'M HOME!" My friends hear me coming wherever I go (though its tough to sneak up on them in that respect). To me, some days, my cough isn't something gross and disgusting, its just something I do every day. It's as natural as breathing.

Caracole is a new company, but like so many in Belgium, the residents inhabit an ancient brewery. Located in Wallonia, near the French border in Falmignoul, Brasserie Moussoux was founded ten years before America was born. In the year the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the name was changed to Brasserie Lamotte before eventually becoming Caracole in the year Clinton was first elected. The brewery is proud of its artisinal heritage, and still brews the old-fashioned way, over a wood fire.

And the knowledge that 24 weeks isn't a magical marker at which all problems vanish is there. I cling to that date, but I am aware of the real statistics. I know the outcomes, and I know that babies still die, that there are still very real and present risks, and longterm complications, and so I am not content with that date either. But at the least, that gives us a chance.
So, slowly, slowly, I learnt that the best treatment for me was simplicity. No more, no less. Good, healthy food, cooked from scratch. No toxic chemicals, no pointless additives, not even thickeners if a reduction will do. No neon drinks or fizzy pop. No synthetic creams or juice "drinks". Add in a dose of sunshine and I feel zingy and alive. Sunshine, fresh air and simple, freshly cooked food.
Examples of physics abound in the natural world. Many animals and plants utilize the natural laws of our universe to live, reproduce, and obtain food. It has been known for many years that bats use high frequency sound waves to echo-locate insects on nightly forays in search of food. What has recently been discovered is a plant that actively encourages bats to drink nectar from it's fruit, and spread pollen in the process by forming echo-genic leaves designed to allow bats an easier time in finding the fruiting portions of the plant. Isn't life marvelous?
Whereas the angels depicted by Giotto and earlier painters had their wings fixed in place because paint can’t move, Guy made the conscious choice (albeit, the easier one) to keep that immobility while allowing the angels themselves to fidget and wander.

Darren Richmond! Well, HE certainly pulled himself together in a hurry, didn’t he? He even made a joke when Jamie was tying up his shoes, and again later to Gwen. I was happy to see Gwen back, actually. It’ll be interesting to see if she and Richmond and Jamie can all just work together, but so far it looks to be going okay. Richmond handled himself perfectly in the interview with the nosey lady, and it looks like Gwen at least feels she can help him win. Actually, I think maybe all three of them think she could be the one to put them over the top – if anyone can.
Not all fear is bad. In fact, fear can be very good & right. The whole subculture centered around 'No Fear' I find to be idiotic actually. Some things should be feared. Crazy man has a gun: let's go walk up to him and call him a wus because we have no fear? That's not just lack of fear that's lack of intelligence. You'll soon be dead: evolution at work if you haven't bred yet. So fear isn't universally bad. It is a survival instinct, and an important one.
The chronic behaviour pattern has to be procrastination. There are some things that continue to escape my best intentions. If there ever was a miscast accountant, it’s me. I really struggle with my own paperwork. My taxes aren’t done, but I have a refund coming so I don’t HAVE to file them. Gonna try and do that this weekend. I am also a, shall we say, less than stellar housekeeper. I think I’d probably be more comfortable in a tidier home. This pattern can be broken…. I just need to examine my motives and

I think as a parent of a child with a disability there is sometimes the tiniest little check, a hesitation when I think about the future. It’s not the gasping for air, punch to the gut it used to be, but sometimes there’s a little catch in the throat as I wonder “Is it realistic?” This is often accompanied by some momma guilt (Do I have the right to wonder what’s realistic?) and some self-doubt (Do I not believe enough in my child?).

Happy New Year everyone. Such a cliche yet.... 2012 sounds good to me. Ever the cockeyed optimist, I've scanned the headlines this morning, the world is in a mess, killing over religion, tribal warfare continues unabated, and yet I still have a deep seated notion that this year may bring some respite from the economic trials of the last several years.
But I’m waiting to actually finish something (and get some fun ‘after’ pics), so those projects will have to wait.
I honor those of you who took the time to post comments on Facebook, after reading my post… your efforts helped me to gain additional perspective… and your words will remain as an inspiration to all those who read them… I am forever grateful for your expressions of love and support…. I really do have the most amazing friends!
So what now for Austria. The ability to tip the scales of power lies in the hand of the Nationalist Parties and given that the "established" traitor parties have said they will not enter into another coalition, anything is now possible.
“I don’t mean the penny. Don’t you feel as if someone’s looking after us?”
It all begins by loving God. It starts with loving God. If we love God, and if we are born of God we will love God, then we cannot help but love those who are also born of him. It is simply incompatible with our heritage and parentage to not love those who belong to the family of God. There should be no civil war in the family of God. But sometimes it seems that the family of God is so fractured that it is perpetually defeated. It makes one wonder how often the enemy capitalizes on this? It makes one wonder what those literally not born of God think about those who claim to be born of God. What sort of family do they believe us to be? What sort of fractured family are we?
Why did I choose HS'ing? I found myself giving my best to other peoples children and having a short fuse with mine. I didn't like it at all...one bit. I wanted to give my best to my children. They deserved it and still do. I knew that if I could spend the majority of my day educating other people's children and loving it (which I did), that I would love it that much more to be able to give that to my babies. I do! I love teaching them. I love it when they teach me, because they do.
By 1953, he began to make collages, which soon became the precursors of pop art, incorporating cigarette logos, images from fan magazines. He coined a phrase for them - "moticos" - and carried them around New York, showing them to strangers in public places and asking for their reactions and recording them (most of this work has been destroyed or recycled).
Why not to watch: It’s a snuff film with a budget.
Seriously, I want to help you guys out.
All of this just confirms my believe that whilst this coalition may repeal a fews laws which I didn't like they are just papering over the cracks of our problem.

Being a quilter, I can't resist the allure of vintage wooden bobbins and spools, and one dealer had a terrific assortment of vintage beehive bobbins—just 50 cents a piece! The larger bobbin pictured was only a $1. I have seen these go for as much as $10 a piece but I suspect their actual value is somewhere in between.

This might be a more exciting "faux-liday" for me than Cinco de Mayo. While I do like tequila (in fact, it's one of the few hard liquors I truly enjoy drinking), I love, love, love my Belgian beers. What a better reason the celebrate them!

I just need to get Kaitlin's information to send her the Cricut Cartridge seen in my blog candy picture- Congratulations! I hope she enjoys it.
Their relationship was not only funny, especially when John would get over-protective and jealous even with his best friend Will, it was adorable and passionate. One of those passionate parts I loved was when John found Meg in a car with Eric, her non-boyfriend boyfriend, and his reaction, a mix of hurt and anger, had me swooning.
There are, of course, plenty of other organizations that cater specifically to service travel-minded retirees–what, and where, are some of your favorites?

The weather forecast threatens more rain tomorrow, which I hope will subside before the afternoon, as I plan to visit Jardin Japonese and Jardin Zoologico. Wouldn't be much fun in the freezing rain or wind. And in any case, I will be more prepared for the weather tomorrow! First thing I will buy in the morning will be a thermos and a set of Yerba Mate. I think I've grown addicted to the bitter stuff, and I can't wait to have my own thermos to carry around like those old men of Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile.

Even though I have a new computer (which is why I've been playing so much Starcraft II and Football Manager 2011 instead of working on my own game), I still use my old laptop when I'm working on Sore Losers: Riot Grrrl (the game I'm developing). I do this because I use MS Paint to create the graphics for this game and the new MS Paint has an annoying habit of changing the colour depth of PNGs when you save them, which causes many a problem if you're using RPGMaker 2003.
Someone who frequently uses the internet for social purposes can validate from one experience or the other the phenomenon of online activism: they come across a particular ideal, message, or situation that has been conveyed to them by other internet users. More often than not these “messages” will resound a cause that is meant to address and expose certain injustices occurring throughout the world. What Sandor Vegh does in his article “Classifying Forms of Online Activism: The Case of Cyberprotests against the World Bank”, is attempts to distinguish between different forms of activism online (as the name suggests), hacking vs. cyberterrorism being one of the main topics of discourse. He then further elaborates on the issue by analyzing what reactions can or should be justified in lieu of a hacker/cyberterrorist campaign.
It would very neat at this point to say I started writing The New Industrial Revolution as a result of this build up of anxiety about the world economy and how to get it in better shape.
1994 was supposed to be change for the better, freedom for all. Where is that freedom? How have things gotten any better?� It hasn’t.� The fact is things have gotten worse.� Not just here in South Africa, but all over the world including the land of the free and home of the brave.� I started reading an e-book by an ex-South African who has been living in UK for the past 12 years, and it is a great place to start to get information about political South Africa and its place in the global conspiracy.� Many of us know that the South African government, the ANC is incredibly corrupt. My question is what will change if, lets say, the DA comes into power?� Im sure there would be change, but would it be enough?� Mandela had such great aspirations and ideas to liberate South Africa and its inhabitants.� What happened to the freedom charter? What happened to those ideals and ideas?� We need to understand that its global politics, every country is at the mercy of those with money, and unfortunately South Africa still owes the IMF a lot of money.� We currently owe approximately $109.4 BILLION.
Besides taking the opportunity to vent about a situation that I find very frustrating, this story seems to me worth telling because it provides something of a parable of the contradictions involved in being a professor of popular music. It's my job to try to cultivate a more sophisticated understanding of popular music and the larger media system through which it's produced. But to do so, I need resources of a sort that are pretty common outside the academic setting but far less so inside. Adding to that, it's important for me not to take the supposedly inevitable tide of technological "progress" as a given. Just because the corporations that earn enormous profits from the production of new technologies have deemed some particular item or format to be obsolete doesn't mean that we should all follow suit. Vinyl may be, in the end, just another commodity item, no more no less, but it was also a dominant form in which people experienced music for the better part of a century, and the notion that we should all dispense with our vinyl archives because of changing media is folly.

In addition to the death benefit, living benefits life insurance policies offer the trifecta of terminal, chronic and critical illness financial protection for insureds and their families. Used as an alternative to traditional long term care insurance, indexed universal life insurance products with living benefits can provide dollars for chronic illness with the added benefit of cash value buildup. Clients who balk at paying a hefty LTC insurance premium may be more than willing to purchase a living benefits index universal life policy as it can provide significant cash value if the policy is surrendered.
In our twisted society the demands of our parents to achieve, to surpass, to excel, to get more material stuff than your fellow neighbour are all seen as commonly accepted things...? In Buddhism, they teach that 'material possessions, kill the soul.'
Seaweed: It wasn't until recently that I discovered how much Heidi and Piper like seaweed. I've tried it and find it tastes too much like sushi without being sushi for me to fully enjoy it. But for them, a whole package is just not enough. They literally stuff these sheets into their mouths while simultaneously asking for more. They're worth a try, if you can find them, and they are also one of the more healthier snack options out there.
Our health care system is in ruins, and only those who have their heads in the sand can't see that. On several levels: loss of work force, cost of medical treatment, cost of insurance, an aging populous, this current "system" stands to wreck our country faster than Social Security, taxes, terrorists, or any competing cause. If we don't address it, it's going to be horribly ironic that the America we think we know will be destroyed by a social issue that right-wingers refused to acknowledge. Get off your high horse and bring solutions to the table. (And by the way, the most plausible solution here is to make health care insurance the responsibility of individuals, not employers. But like so many things, we all know that's not going to happen, either.)
Here's a clip of the opening credits. It's just...so odd. I can't look away.
We did learn a lot about the fort (not a walled fort like most of them), and the Buffalo Soldiers who were stationed there. This is a monument of Corporal Clinton Graves, one of the soldiers who fought the Apaches and received a Medal of Honor.
i'd just seen some cute drinking glasses and jars with mini chalkboards for labeling at world market, and thought that i could perhaps cover up the red floral vines with some chalkboard paint and use the jars in my "new" kitchen (i really changed a lot of stuff up!).
What really pisses me off, is that it has taken until now for the people of this once great nation to take a stand, and that the stand is being taken against white, Christian Europeans. If, instead of Italian and Polish workers, these jobs had been given to non-European immigrants from Africa, Asia or the Caribbean would the Politically correct brain washing have kicked in, and would those now protesting stayed at home to watch “Hustle” or some other Common Purpose approved propaganda with a take away curry. I hope not, but I fear so.

A week or so ago, my wife brought home two French movies on DVD, OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and its sequel, OSS 117: Lost in Rio. They’re spy spoofs, a kind of French Austin Powers series, starring the delightful Jean Dujardin (he won this year’s Best Actor Oscar for The Artist) as the hopelessly out of touch, (almost) hilariously bigoted French spy OSS 117.

Don’t be afraid to look around at different stores or internet retailers. Look to see what the prices are at each store before you decide to make a purchase. If you are looking online, don’t forget to add taxes and shipping/handling to your final cost. Amazon and NewEgg might have the same product at the same price, but if Amazon is giving you free shipping, then in the end that is who you should go to.
In 2002, the American Association of Poison Control Centers launched a nationwide toll-free hotline for prevention and treatment of poisonings. The number is (800) 222-1222. In the case of any suspected poisoning emergency, they can be contacted 24 hours a day.

Growing up I have such fond memories of both of my grandmothers.
About the book -
My last dog, Chase, was a golden retriever (or as I referred to him “Love of my life”). He ate up the adoration. Long before he was fully grown, it became clear he did not realize he was a dog, and I wasn’t going to break it to him…considering I was the one feeding him off my plate and baby-talking to my “Chaser-doodle-puppy-wuppy”. This quintessential family pet was the constant sidekick everyone gathered around at each soccer game to pet and spoil.
Anyhow...

Besides, it was time to leave Socorro. Just before he skipped town, some copper swore he saw little green men over a hill on top of a mesa. G-men, the Air-Force and every hack reporter from La La Land to the Big Apple swarmed into the small town.

Never changing who,
What struck me about the two trips being so close together is the clear level of white, entitled anger that permeated fading-Midwestern-resort. The vacationing people on the island were a) clearly quite well off financially and b) supposed to be enjoying a leisurely holiday. Nonetheless, it seemed like every time I turned around all I heard was people obsessing about how they thought Obama had done them wrong and how this country was “on the road to socialism.” They were also numerous, numerous anti-immigrant statements. This occurred despite the fact that the very resort that was catering to them at that very moment clearly depended on immigrant labor. It was astounding to me that an entire island’s worth of people who are so fortunate (especially in a region with the highest unemployment) could continue to demand more and more of the pie. They have everything that they could possibly want and yet it simply wasn’t enough. Much to my horror, they also managed to say that every African-American waiter who served them “looked like Obama.” I find it unlikely that I will ever return to fading-Midwestern-resort.

This is just a glimpse of my crazy brain. Needless to say I was in an unhealthy state regarding my relationship with food, one that had been taking place for several years prior to coming to Portland.
Our lab instructor told us that most patients won't need help with perineal care and prefer to take care this themselves. As our course packet helpfully suggests, "Most patients understand what is meant is the nurse simply says, 'I'll give you a washcloth to finish your bath.'" Later I was saying that suggested phrasing is helpful. Of course someone was going to hear that as suggestive phrasing. Hilarity ensued.

I wanted to make a mini version of the tart, I've always liked mini everything as I think it is prettier. The tart dough I had was from Pierre Herme recipe, same one as I used in this lemon tart. I used the same recipe for the passion fruit cream, just substituted passion fruit for the lemon. As expected, the resulting cream is bursting with passion fruit flavor and as smooth as it can be. I made the leftover joconde and cream and raspberry jelly to make the cake version of it and it is equally good!
Yet, this simple concept of right and wrong gets muddled by differing ideas about religion, patriotism, economics and many other divisions. The “just war” rule has crumbled under the ambitions of empires throughout history. The American-led Anglo Saxon empire is no different.

Or it might mean having a serious go at self-publishing. Many are seizing the opportunity to publish or re-publish their own books. For some, this is a bold and exciting step forward. For others it may be a last resort. Either way, some authors are beginning to do very well from it.

We want to you share this special character or book/series with us and your followers. Tell us about them: share pictures, passages, quotes, excerpts, etc. Then offer that book as a giveaway to share the love. We all want the chance to be besotted, carried away, and/or charmed. So, introduce us to that special character that has left you love-struck.

I had some goals to workout just as much and eat well on my week off Feb. weight loss challenge. I however did not stick to them. I let stress get to me and had a few days where I ate some junk food and drank a couple sodas. I also only exercised about three of the days. I surprisingly lost a half a pound still even on my week off. So I am thinking building some muscle doing more strength training is helping me burn calories easier. I am totally ready for this challenge again. So I am going to blog once again while I am doing the 21 Day Mommy Bloggers Weight Loss Challenge, sponsored by Dustin Maher.

Morello: What was yesterday?
One of the many reasons I started this blog was to connect with people and share stories and info about running. It’s mostly been one-way but I get that people are scared to share their stories and comments. I get it, I was like that. But this little exercise in public writing has helped me quite a bit. And I’ve connected with people who I wouldn’t have otherwise. So it’s not all bad!
And that strength is even more available to us today, because God has expressed his character most vividly in Christ (Heb. 1:1-3).
Yet, ironically as Jamaican sprinters are finding success by flocking to their country's top sprint coaches in droves, we here in the US seem to be slipping as our athletes are running the other way from our top coaches! Spearmon had great success with Braumann, but left to train with his father. Carter began having success with Holloway (in spite of injury) but left. Wariner was seemingly on his way to the WR in the 400 but left Hart - and my grapevine says that Sanya Richards is considering a similar move. Does anyone think that the Lakers will be getting rid of Phil Jackson any time soon? I didn't think so.
Luke kept trying to fall over. No matter how many times we told him to stay put, he just couldn't keep his feet in the boat. Then, he noticed that he had splashed a bunch of water into the boat so he grabbed our DRY towel and began sopping up the water. Aaggh! We tried to explain to him that it was OK for there to be water in the bottom of the boat. I should have just thrown him overboard...

I eventually ended up running the 2010 Chicago Marathon and the 2011 Chicago Marathon as well – both for charities. I figured that if was going to run, I might as well run for a great cause, since I knew it drove and inspired me. I eventually ended up loving distance running, mainly because I’m able to run free and enjoy and appreciate the world around me, not to mention, God gave me the ability to do so, and I don’t want to take that for granted.

At the guide’s feet was a thin, white line, perhaps two inches wide, that was comprised of some kind of granular powder. It stretched off in either direction, curving away into the fiery haze of the silent, dead wood. “Is that salt?” Stolik asked, nudging it with his toe.

I wonder what Kevin Donlan has in mind when he speaks of “a new model for a new day.” I have finished a careful study of the new Rwandan canons and the Anglican Mission canonical charter. They evidence the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law in language, doctrine, norms, and principles. In a number of places the Rwandan canons clearly are repudiation of the Thirty-Nine Articles and of authentic historic Anglicanism, and embrace in their place the dogmas of the Council of Trent. The provisions governing the relationship of the Rwandan Primate with Anglican Primatial Vicar Chuck Murphy are based upon the provisions of the Roman Catholic Code of Canon Law governing the relationship of the Pope to lesser bishops of the Roman Catholic Church. This causes me also to wonder what part Donlan himself played in their formulation.

So my wish for today to Jan Marie is to have a day of happiness, laughter, relaxation, and so much fun you can't see straight!

“Amen, amen I say to you, the eighth day will be the day of great rejoicing and gladness, for Satan’s long reign of terror shall be finally over and My Son shall establish His glorious reign in your midst. Yes, creation will once again belong rightfully to Me, and persons shall live in accord with My holy and divine Will. Love shall be the law of the land as brother will assist brother, sister shall assist sister, and holiness, humility, simplicity and justice shall reign supreme. This shall be the new era. This shall constitute the new heavens and the new earth, and it shall only be in the light of My divine Truth that you shall begin to understand how ensnared the world, at this present time, truly is. It will only be after the victory has been won, that the collective eyes of humanity shall be opened wide for the first time, like a new-born babe, realizing that it is finally free of its tremendous burden of sin and death. For I Am Who Am and all of these things shall come to pass. So shall it be, for I Am the Lord” (2/6/12).

After the concert, both Marcus and Sam manned the merchandise table. In between selling CDs and t-shirts, they signed autographs, posed for pictures, and gave hugs. I was one of the first in line to buy new music and get my CDs signed by both. Marcus took my ninja marker, but I figured he needed it more than I did! I got my picture with both and received a couple hugs as well. These guys are so friendly, genuine, and gracious to their fans. Before I walked away, both were adamant about saying, “thank you.” I wish them so much luck for future success.

It’s also particularly important in our physical practice, because it’s easy to “fake it” in certain poses. I find myself doing this more than I would like. I can cheat my leg a little higher in Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana, but if I am honest with myself and drop my hip in line with the other, the limitations of my hamstrings come into play and I have to work a lot harder. Being honest with your body and where you’re at safeguards you from injury. If you’re not strong enough in your core and shoulders to lower in chatturanga, practice with your knees on the floor until you build strength. Use props as tools to guide you deeper in your practice and support you.

“The purposes of the First International Psychedelic Exposition are manifold. On one level we hope to give the general public a glimpse of the psychedelic world and the beautiful creations it has inspired. On another level we hope that open and forthright exposition of psychedelic phenomena by the people it has inspired will facilitate communication between those who are somewhat fearful of the mind expansion experience and those who have had the experience and found a method to present what they found most worthwhile, be it through music, art, visual techniques, or group events.” The catalog also promoted “a common drug available to anyone with $5.00 to spare – lysergic acid diethylamide”.
We arrive home without further incident and it's the strangest sensation. We've twitched and sweated against the restrictions of curfew for two days, yet while we were out for the brief official break, we were jumpy and anxious to get back to the relative safety of our yard. Then, as soon as we're back, we fret, wanting to go out again. Especially as the pressure we're all under, freaked and forced into such close company with one another, means that tensions in the house simmer below the surface at all times, breaking out into frequent arguments that I have to try to mediate.
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now.

One of the only parts I had to totally replace, was the three speed shifter switch and cable. I rounded up an unused piece on eBay for about $9.00. The cable was a few inches longer than what I needed, but it worked just fine. As you can see.. I added a little flair to the bike with some Electra flame grips that I had lying around.

On September 11, 2002 I was walking through Ground Zero in New York City, where the Twin Towers had been attacked just a year ago by terrorists. As I was standing there watching people go through all those feeling and emotions of sadness, I discovered the style of photography that I love and feel passionate about–street photography.

I was just about to tell him that I wasn't here for him when all of a sudden he did a face plant onto the curb. I heard his face hit and then I heard the group of people moan. Then I saw the look of horror on their faces as the poor guy stood up. I could see why the horrified look on their faces as he turned to look at me. His lip was cut and spurting blood, his eye was beginning to swell as if someone was blowing up a balloon and his forehead had so much blood leaking from a gash that it looked like a road map. He just sort of looked at me with this dazed and confused smile, turned and walked away.
Can you remember back to when you had babies to care for and how careful you were with their bedding? You'd make sure the sheets were clean and straight, you'd make the little bed several times a day and as soon as there was a wet sheet, into the washing machine it would go. You did those things, and more, because you knew how important that bed was to your baby. Well, I might be reverting to babyhood because I tend my bed as carefully as I would a cot or crib and I do it because sleep is important. Now let me declare my bias here up front. I LOVE my bed, always have, always will. I am a good sleeper. I'm rarely in bed more than ten minutes before I'm sound asleep. But I also do a lot of my thinking in bed in the cool dark hours of the morning and being in an uncomfortable bed would not be conducive to my sleeping or thinking. If I want to get the most out of every day, I need to sleep well.
In her article, ‘Should the church connect with the Occupy movement?’, St. Francis of Assisi Pastoral Administrator Valerie Chapman, whom at least one local journalist erroneously identifies as “pastor” of the Southwest Portland parish, attempts to convince readers that Catholic Social Teaching tends to support the work(s) of Occupy Wall Street.
I'm pretty happy with what I wrote for HOUND's sequel, though, and it seems to want my attention. I'm trying to fend it off, but being on query for HOUND makes me think about HOUND, which makes me think about what I could do with world and characters next.
Bertie eyed the entrails hungrily. “If you don’t want to, I could finish it off for you?” he offered gallantly, already starting to skulk forward. Reginald narrowed his eyes. Bertie waited. “All the same, Bertie, I need to eat it all,” Reginald sniffed delicately, turning his head away with mild distaste, ”however much it may pain me to consume the revolting morsels,” he added and then looked incredulously at the bare ground where the revolting morsels were no longer in evidence. “Thanks a lot Bertie!” he hissed. “You are such a liability. And a major pain in the scruff.“

I am lucky, I get to look at beautiful objects every day in the museum, but I am envious of the people who got to live and work with these things. I am awestruck with how much detail objects like this elevator façade have. The museum’s own elevators have plain flat facades that neither distinguish or mask them.

The plotting and engineering involved in the first few chapters of the story is a marvel to behold. Davis manages to create four separate mysteries: who is Gene Swendsen, the new chauffeur? What really happened to Kitten in that auto accident? Why is Hilda, her sister, such a nervous wreck? And is the person in the room upstairs really Kitten? Mysterious phone calls to the man who delivered Swendsen to the Corwith home add to the suspense. Each chapter ends with an italicized section that give us insight into "the patient" in the room upstairs. We know the thoughts and feelings of "the patient" and watch as this person turns the pages of a diary written, of course, in the first person but with all references to Kitten in the third person. The diary starts out with glowing entries showing admiration for Kitten then reveal petty envy and finally explode into bitter hatred. But then the diary can't be Kitten's, can it? Why refer to herself in the third person? And if it isn't Kitten's diary, whose is it and how did the patient get a hold of it?

So, today we went and got some birthday pictures made of the girls. I just took the cheap route, with JC Penny. It is always so challenging to get a good picutre of them. I really hope to get my friend to photograph them before we leave, maybe in the Spring. Anyway, we got a couple of good ones. Carolina turned out to be the harder one, because almost all of hers were fake smiles. So, then she wanted sausage and eggs, so we headed to Cracker Barrell. Then we went to Classroom Corner and got a few "learning" things. I got her some lined paper to help in practicing her writing and some dot-to-dot books, she loves! On the way home you could see the sky forever and the clouds were so interesting against a bright blue. I told Lina to look how big God must be to such a huge sky. She said , yes, He must be that big, then she said "those clouds are so rowdy!" I'm not sure where she came up with that one.

10. Yesterday, I was reminded how great a family I’ve got. My older sister was fighting a sinus headache and went to bed early, so my brother-in-law, who doesn’t often feel well, took charge of little A. until bedtime, when my mom took over. Before that, my mom was finishing a project for work, so I was able to clean the kitchen and make a cake she had to have for today. That’s the sort of thing my mom has taught us and it’s really wonderful to be able to help each other. My dad is great to help out, too, as are Sisters #1 and #2, though Sis #2 isn’t home that often. I just love the attitude of servanthood in a house. It makes life so much easier for everyone!

I’m a very weird person. I like taking pictures of everything….literally. I say literally more than the average human being. I suppose by saying literally it will enforce the fact that what I am saying is so literal that you can have zero questions about it. Its weird. I have an odd obsession with pronouncing words correctly. People make fun of me and the way I say “clothes”. I literally (here we go) say kuh-lo-thiz. Thats probably phonetically wrong but it just sounds like it is spelled. I was terrible in English though. I don’t know why I have that habit. I’m severely random. I get excited about new things, hence the reason I started a blog. I make weird faces and noises. All day, errrryday. But that’s me. When I’m really tired I start to get even weirder. Ok, done rambling.

The house, built by George Washington Vanderbilt II (grandson to railroad tycoon Cornelius "Commodore" Vanderbilt) is extremely impressive. Finished in 1895, the 135,000 square foot house contains 250 rooms, including a 70,000 gallon heated indoor swimming pool and a bowling alley. It remains today as the largest privately-owned home in the country.

You can set your own rules and your own standards. I live on my writing income, so if I'd written three wonderful novels and not yet sold them, that would be a failure. If you're a full-time pilot with five children and no partner, writing two pages might be a massive success. Be realistic.

He came from impeccable matrilineal succession of the Royal house. He was connected to Bridei son of Beli (c.672-93) who had fought ‘for the inheritance of his (maternal) grandfather’ at Dunnichen when Nechtan was an impressionable child at court. So the cataclysmic turnaround of affairs which resulted, of great Northumbria having to hand back part of conquered Pictland to the Picts, must have made a deep impression on him.
The children are in school for five and a half hours a day. If they sleep ten hours, they still have seven and a half hours to play and socialize.

About the director:
In April 2006, Leeds university authorities subjected Dr Frank Ellis to an Inquisition after he had an interview published in “Leeds Student". Dr Ellis was sought out for the interview with political bias in mind because of his “peculiar and extreme views". He and his interviewer ranged over many topics but what ignited prejudice against him were his remarks that the average black has a lower IQ than the average white or Asian; that he believed we need to introduce a policy of humane repatriation. There were the usual demonstrations by Unite Against Fascism. The University's decision was purely to persecute a man for holding the wrong opinion: he treated his students fairly and impartially as the interviewer acknowledged Dr Ellis’s “excellent rapport with his students and colleagues". Further, Leeds have a system to prevent unfair marking as the candidate's paper is anonymous and each is marked by 3 different tutors. He was investigated by the West Yorkshire police for incitement to racial hatred. So what is the problem? Dr Ellis was not disciplined for his conduct towards his students, which was exemplary, but persecuted for not expressing the right thoughts on race. In an interview on Talk Sport Ian Collins screamed at Ellis, ”You're mad!” (7)

I really need to start planning more seriously before buying. And then follow through on those plans. Before Christmas I had a vague, half formed idea in my head that it would be really good to make dried apricots in brandy as a gift for my lovely mother. Sadly, time ran away with me and they never did get made. I did accomplish the first step of the plan to make them though... I bought the dried apricots. Really quite a lot of apricots as it happens, because the Kilner jar I was planning on using can take quite a lot of fruit and I thought having a few spare wouldn't be a problem.

Right here we have a cross-pollination of a zombie flick, jungle action, Rambo shoot-em-up, voodoo horror and Friday the 13th gore job. This is like a discount closeout at the Everything Must Go Cliche Store with macho mercenaries, damsels in distress, harrowing escapes, creatures leaping out of the shadows, shocking bloody effects and an ending that is as nihilistic as it is stupid. It's like the film-makers had to do something with all of these leftovers from every other movie made in 1989 so they lumped them all in here, slapped a title on it and hoped for the best.

Unable to stand by as Madison’s future is ripped from her, The Duke, who has inexplicably fallen for the lady he soiled and deserted, makes plans to forge a new future for Madison, a future where he is her husband…whether she likes it or not.

What is the reaction of man when Jesus Christ reveals Himself? We want to look at this in three ways and one of these will relate to you. Naturally we look at Saul of Tarsus. He had been blind spiritually, not comprehending the light. In John 1:5 we see this truth. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.” Up to this point Saul did not recognise his spiritual condition of being in darkness.

There are several varieties of kelp: true kelp, which thrives in cool seas; giant kelp, and bladder kelp, which grow in the North Pacific. Giant kelp is so named because it grows to 213 ft (65 m). Kelp anchors itself to rocky surfaces via tentacle-like roots. From these roots grows a slender stalk with long, leaf-like blades.
Spoon out about 1/3 cup of dough for each shortcake onto the baking sheet, leaving about 3 inches of space between the mounds. Pat each mound down until it is between 3/4 and 1 inch high. (The shortcakes can be made to this point and frozen on the baking sheet, then wrapped airtight and kept in the freezer for up to 2 months. Bake without defrosting – just add at least 5 more minutes to the oven time.)
Apparently this is available on a DVD of Frank Tashlin’s THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT, which is vaguely apt, but it should really be an extra with VERTIGO. Both because of the ways in which Jones’s visuals approach Saul Bass’s (the YouTuber who posted it apparently thinks it’s by Norman McLaren — a fair guess, but WRONG), and in the way the short reverses the sympathies engendered in Hitchcock’s film — a woman trapped and torn and manipulated and molded between two horrible men is replaced by a female manipulator who remodels the men in her life, rejecting the less adaptable model in favour of the one who can literally be bent to her will.

To answer that question, we need to think about the speed of the moral revolution that has pushed this question to the forefront of our culture. In less than a generation, homosexuality has gone from being almost universally condemned to being almost fully normalized in the larger society.
Born on September 15, 1956, Willie Mullins was six-times amateur champion rider in Ireland and his major successes in the saddle included the 1983 John Smith’s Fox Hunters’ Chase at Aintree on Atha Cliath when the also-rans were partnered by the likes of Robert Waley-Cohen and Aintree chairman Lord Daresbury, before taking out a training licence in 1988 and is now the country’s pre-eminent jump handler. As a jockey in the John Smith’s Grand National, his rides included The Ladys Master, who ran out in 1983, and Hazy Dawn, who fell at the sixth the following year. He hails from one of Ireland’s most famous racing families, being a son of the late Paddy Mullins, the outstanding all-round trainer whose most famous star was Dawn Run, winner of the 1984

Too often, people fall into the trap of strife. Someone says something that rubs you the wrong way, and before you know it, there is tension, quarreling and division. The Bible tells us that strife opens the door to “every evil work.” It’s the enemy’s greatest trap to keep people from living in victory. But you don’t have to fall into the trap of strife, you can rise above it. Like today’s verse says, you can simply drop the matter before it turns into something bigger than it needs to be. You don’t have to sink down to somebody’s level and argue with them and try to prove that you’re right. You weren’t put on this earth to correct everybody around you.

One morning I was laying in bed praying about an "Titanic idea" when the prodigal son story popped into my mind. Was it possible that the seed of the idea I had so many years prior fit on the Titanic? I dug back through my old computer files and found the original prologue. Then, in my mind's eye, the story of a younger son, an older son, a woman who cared for them both--and the loving father--played out in my mind.

A few weeks back, I was an enjoying a dinner with some good friends. Over dinner, the conversation turned to ice cream (this is a common occurrence when you hang out with me). Specifically, my friends expressed their delight at being members of the Dairy Queen Blizzard Fan Club. Every couple of months, they receive coupons for free Blizzards. All this time, DQ had been handing out free ice cream I’d been paying full price like a chump! Not long after we parted ways, I too signed up for the DQ Blizzard Club. Over the past few weeks, my husband has signed up, my sisters have signed up, and if it were allowed I’d get my cat to sign up too. I’ve now become accustomed to a weekly Blizzard, with or without coupons. It’s crossed over to that dangerous place when I eat an item of food so much I give it an obnoxious nickname. Observe:
Great cast, good music (seeing it again I note the little "heroic action!" stings and other tricks of the music more) and naturally lots of funny.

As discussed in earlier posts, a lot has to do with the weather, time of day, lighting and the location of the sun relative to the photographer and the dog / handler team. Also, the use of a zoom lens can remove a good portion of the background, which allows the dog and handler to become the most dominant element within the frame. But, zooming in is not always the best choice as many of the exercises require tracking the dog down the field and getting the shot at a critical moment.
Another example of the transition to a racialist America is African-Americans’ success in removing much of the negativity associated with color by changing the connotations of darkness. Black has become beautiful and not just for blacks. Furthermore, the recent preference for being called blacks instead of African-Americans suggests greater comfort in being perceived first and foremost as black Americans.

Let's see... Ty is currently applying for other jobs. He's applying in Alaska as well as here in Bellingham. He applied at a Jewelers amongst other things. Good timing if he gets that, Christmas sales will be up.
We traditionally camp when we're on Salt Spring, but this time my mom and step dad rented a beautiful old heritage home for the week. The kitchen was amazing, with custom built free standing fir cabinets and an AGA. Though I've always wanted an AGA (which is always warm and ready for use), it kind of lost its charm when we were hit with a heat wave, at which point everyone gave the kitchen a wide berth.
Why: I was admiring some art from Draw Something (are you playing? I can't get enough. We literally lie in bed drawing and laughing and cornholing except Buster) when I spotted this:
#739 - Anatomy of a Murder (1959) - (#872 on TSPDT) Jimmy Stewart is one of those actors who never seem like they are acting. He is just smoothly natural with a homespun charm that covers up how sharp-witted and powerful of an actor he truly is. His performance in this Otto Preminger film is one of his finest, but such a great film as this - one of Preminger's finest as well - is already quite spectacular, even without Stewart. But yeah, he certainly makes it better. Many in the field of law have called this the most accurate look at a court trial ever put onto film, but more importantly, much more importantly (who wants truth when they can have the artifice of the most beautiful fraud in the world - yeah, I said it), is that Preminger has sewn together a succulent and quite devious motion picture experience, and one of the main contributing factors (along with Some Like it Hot and Psycho) to the eventual downfall of the Hays Code in Hollywood.
Well, the drought is definitely over. We've been getting our normal rainy afternoons almost every day for the last week or so (I think) I'm starting to remember now that we live in a sort of bog here in NF. It was starting to feel more like a dessert for a while there. (Or is it desert? I get those confused. One is a hot place with sand and one is a sweet treat... My spelling sucks.) And you know, at 48 years old, I should be embarrassed by that, but I just don't really care. Ten years ago I would have been, but now not so much. I just accept it as one of my quirks. Yea, that's it, I'm quirky!
Heh...none really..except for Del McCoury (Friday 1:50 - 2:30 Austin Ventures Stage) ...go see them and clap your hands. Does anyone else think there should be a few more? Of course my rule with Bluegrass is 3 songs is just enough.
Second, we are training Afghan Security Forces to get the job done. Those forces have surged, and will peak at 352,000 this year. The Afghans will sustain that level for three years, and then reduce the size of their military. And in Chicago, we will endorse a proposal to support a strong and sustainable long-term Afghan force.
After my own scripture and prayers, and a bit of time in the bathroom to get ready, I will then start getting breakfast ready. I am trying to be better about making breakfast for Steve before he leaves. Many of my breakfasts I will prep the night before so it's easier in the morning.

The FCC knew about the issues it now wants to study in this newest NPRM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making) before the spectrum was auctioned in 2008. Further, the interference issues were taken into account by the FCC at that time, and informed the rules under which the spectrum was auctioned and purchased.
I do think beer blogs have a valid, and dare I say important, place in beer though. Beer rating blogs are a dime a dozen. Nation wide beer blogs...also a dime a dozen. But the local beer blog I think is a vital and helpful resource, not to pat myself on the back. Also, (Warning: I am going to pat myself on the back again) blogs or sites like My Last Pint and Pints and Panels are fun (I guess not so important, but still) because of their uniqueness and creativity.
Now, THIS is what I'm talking about. No werewolves. No vampires. No British isles fairytale constructs. No Arthurian legends, creaky with age, being unfolded and poorly cleansed of the dust of ages for the nth, nth, nth time. No. This is neither the U.S. nor the UK, but Trenčín, Slovenia, baby.

Mom was pessimistic and tried to dissuade me. But already a budding foodie and curious about most things culinary, my argument was simple. We liked fruit. We like cake. We liked my grandmother’s blueberry cake which combined fruit and cake. It only made sense that we would like this fruitcake from Texas.

The SF Arts Commission reeled from stupid decision to scandal as news broke that they had chosen former dog murderer Tom Otterness for a huge project to make sculptures for the Central Subway - which is another scandal but not an artistic one. Eventually, the commission "fired" him but because of legal issues, still had to let him keep a substantial portion of the grant money. Lots of SF artists were asking why the "SF" Arts Commission couldn't chose a local artist! http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/31/DD941MG3BJ.DTL
All that walking is as rejuvenating as the sleep and relaxation. It's also a key to eating pastry without guilt or weight gain. We typically cover 8-12 miles a day in Paris, but with all that walking we're paradoxically less hungry. My theory is that the food we are eating is so delicious that we need less of it to feel satisfied. We've never dined at any restaurant with a star, Michelin or otherwise, while in Paris. We prefer to find neighborhood bistros, or stock up on cheeses, fruit, bread and chocolate at the little epicerie around the corner from our hotel. The epicerie is pricier than a grocery store, but they have a fabulous selection of cheeses, and they make amazing puff pastry tomato tarts with pesto. Or we pick up a couple of pastries from a patisserie (always checking Paris Pâtisseries first). We open our window and stare down at the rooftops of the city we love while enjoying our room picnic.

The Full Moon of April is usually called the Egg Moon. In Algonquian it is called Pink Moon. Other names are Sprouting Grass Moon, Fish Moon, Seed Moon, and Waking Moon. In Hindi it is known as Hanuman Jayanti. The Full Moon rises around sunset and sets around sunrise, the only night in the month when the Moon is in the sky all night long. The rest of the month, the Moon spends at least some time in the daytime sky.
Despite being selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the late rounds of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, he never was invited by the Flyers to participate in a training camp and came to North America as a free agent in 1997. He started in the lower reaches of the minors, first with the Baton Rouge Kingfish of the ECHL. He then joined the Manitoba Moose of the IHL for 14 games, going 8-4-1-1.
Is how the wizard "Amazing" Kreskin described their foes in the graveyard of Barrow Island. In last night's Weird Adventures game (in Lorefinder), Boris, Kreskin, and Don Diabolico were ambushed by ghoul hooligans out for dangerous kicks. The punks got danger in a lethal dose: The fact that that were teenagers didn't spare them from the guns of our hardboiled adventurers. Only one of the three attackers escaped with his life.

PT: For many entrepreneurs, starting their company may be their first experience in a business management role – how can strong leadership skills better assist them in their new endeavor?
With Hanna’s retreat from the spotlight and the failed media blackout controversy, the second half of Girls to the Front feels much different from the first. The LA Times Evelyn McDonnell put it simply: “If the first part of Marcus’ book is exhilarating, the end can be depressing. Instead of supporting ‘girl love,’ as they’d earlier vowed, members turned against one another and their male sympathizers.” Corin Tucker and others took Fugazi to task for its song “Suggestion” which describes sexual harassment from a female perspective. As Marcus points out, few other male bands of Fugazi’s reputation even broached the subject let alone accused its audience of complicity, yet to some in the RG it sounded “like a self righteous white boy appropriating girls’ issues so he could appear more virtuous.” (116) Hanna dismissed similar efforts by other bands: “A lot of this white straight edge boy thing singing about sexism is so incredibly stupid to me, I just can’t even deal with it.” (229)

The Russian Foreign Minister stressed that the Security Council should adopt what will be issued by the UN observers not by the group of the so-called Friends of Syria, adding” they say they will evaluate how the Syrian leadership is implementing Annan’s plan, which is unacceptable.”

Jeff Andrews – I have been (and continue to be) influenced by so many things. Amazing master designers like Billy Haines, David Hicks and Andre Putman have definitely inspired me. More contemporary designers like Barbara Barry, Kerry Joyce and Roy McMakin have continued to influence me on different levels. I would have to say that I am most influenced by people of talent and taste that have lived a life of style that we most of us can only dream of and learn from…Yves Saint Laurent, Rudolph Nureyev and Coco Chanel to name a few. It is all about pulling bits that inspire you most and making them your own in design that make it a personally rewarding experience.
So why are the people voicing dissatisfaction with the ending of a product they loved, in this medium, suddenly whiners/cretins/bros/entitled? I think it’s a statement of optimism on the complainer’s part really. They know that video games offer the chance to be continually upgraded/changed (through DLCs and mods). Knowing that, why wouldn’t they suggest they want an ending they like? It’s like telling someone at a restaurant that they can’t add or subtract anything to the dish they order, because “that’s going against the chef’s vision.” My request for capers or no mayonnaise doesn’t make me entitled. It means I’m using the service as it is expected in the given situation. The folks at Bioware pretty much promise that there’s going to be DLC available (and there was already some on launch day), so it isn’t even like these gamer/restaurant-goers are going to a really expensive, high-end dinner (where it is Not Done to request substitutions. At those restaurants you really are going and paying for the chef’s vision). They’re going to a Red Lobster and are upset when the server, chef, and other patrons call them babies for not wanting the french fries, but would prefer broccoli instead.
There are 2 shades to this, #1 Light Beige and #2 Natural Beige (which I bought). I’m thinking the recommended retail price of this is 60,000Won, which is around US$56. However, the duo cost me only US$72, so each was just USD$36!! Pretty amazing deal if you ask me =)

The reality is, I am not using one Google extension or FireFox add-on. Not a single one. At least, if it did not come pre-installed, I am not using it. I used to use the add-blocker that was famed on FireFox, but to be honest, I have left that browser, and even am using IE a lot less in favor of Chrome. I might not like Google as a company much, but Chrome is a pretty solid, fast and ‘visually’ light browser.

Some 1,000 protesters marched in Tel Aviv on Saturday night in a show of opposition to the possibility of an Israeli strike in Iran. Over 2,300 citizens confirmed their attendance on Facebook. The march, titled "Israelis against a war with Iran," began at Habima Square and was expected to conclude with a rally at Meir Park.
Overall the walking/jogging wasn’t all that bad, maybe I am in not nearly as bad of shape as I was thinking before. My legs didn’t really feel like jello till the very last jog. One the cool down walk, that is when I started to feel my knees starting to hurt.

External additions can be problematic if your bigger and better house is out of character with the surrounding neighborhood in size and style. It can be even worse if your do-it-yourself project lacks professional polish. Even more modest improvements — such as doors, windows or awnings — can hurt if they don’t match your home’s architectural style.

Casey’s Contraptions:
Moderate consumption of alcohol (1-2 drinks daily) increases the levels of HDL cholesterol in blood. However, it does not lower the amount of LDL cholesterol. Although drinking alcohol in moderation is considered to prevent heart diseases, no consensus has been reached by the medical fraternity regarding this belief. In fact drinking too much alcohol raises triglyceride levels and increases blood pressure.

Now we have animal poems on our agenda for this morning.
Coming down from the mountain to a new life in the city seems a thrill beyond imagining. When Miri and her friends from Mount Eskel set off to help the future princess Britta prepare for her royal wedding, she is happy about her chance to attend school in the capital city. There, Miri befriends students who seem so sophisticated and exciting . . . until she learns that they have some frightening plans. They think that Miri will help them, that she should help them. Soon Miri finds herself torn between loyalty to the princess and her new friends’ ideas, between an old love and a new crush, and between her small mountain home and the bustling city.

I paused. Because life had taught me a lot of things by this point and one of them was – not everyone wants to know the truth all the time. They want to tell you SOME things, so you’ll know they have a life. Maybe they want you to think it’s cool or eccentric, maybe they’re looking for comfort. What they don’t want you to do, is tell them how you really feel, which in this case was APPALLED.

Minorities: Broadly refers to anyone who isn’t a white American. According to the Book of Mormon, God invites “all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God” (2 Ne. 26:33). Because all are alike, church members are counseled to “marry those who are of the same racial background” (Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3).

You see, Harold convinced his followers, something “did” happen on May 21. It just didn’t happen where anyone could see it. It was a “spiritual” event. God judged the world on that day, and closed the door to salvation. (Like when God closed the door on Noah’s Ark once Noah and family were inside.) Only those who were inside the Ship on that day will be saved when the Ultimate End comes on October 21 and the whole world is destroyed. The job of Family Radio now is only to “feed the sheep” inside the Ark. Only five more months to sail, and then all the waiting will be over. Really. Guaranteed.

I cannot comprehend the turmoil, upset and distress Michael, his wife, family and friends have experienced over the past few days. My thoughts and my support are with him, and I would hope all those who have followed his blog and the advice and warnings he writes on an almost daily basis provide the same thoughts and support. In doing so, he has found himself the victim of a despicable attack on a platform of the Internet so many authors now use to have their voices heard and their books bought and read.

There is, therefore, special need of public liberality on their behalf . . . . Contributions may he addressed to George T. Strong, Treasurer. No. 68 Wall St., New York.”

Perhaps, it would be a good move for Labour to adopt a more mature attitude of a similar spirit, sort out which message it wants to get out and act in a more constructive manner and work with the government to find a solution. At the moment the Labour party appears opportunistic, not only on policy relating to income, tax evasion and charity giving but on a range of issues. Labour needs to start showing itself as a credible alternative as a government rather than an anti-coalition party. Or maybe that’s their election strategy and they’ll just fill in Miliband’s blank sheet of paper if and when he gets into Number 10…

I competed my first trade with Craig2 over on the SCF hockey boards. He posted a bunch of cards he was looking to move, and one caught my eye. I requested a price and a scan, and though he couldn't provide a scan at that time, he informed me the card featured a patch piece nicer than similar ones found on eBay. He said he'd send it my way and I could just send him $5 or so later on.
But the thoughts are trickling back, and I know that the more I write, the more they'll start flooding back, and so relief is in sight there, too.

It was definitely time to try a new enchilada sauce. This sauce goes with an enchilada recipe I'll be posting shortly. I decided to throw out the chile powders for this one and use actual dried chiles. Chipotles are a spicy, smoky dried chile that work in a lot of dishes. This one worked well with the addition of a little cinnamon and some oregano.

Sending everyone lots of love out there in honor of Valentine's Day. Have any big plans? My man and I will be having a mellow evening in tonight... although we already sort of celebrated on Sunday by going to a Swell Season concert at a teeny venue (this was our 8th time seeing them live. I'll admit it. We're groupies and proud). As always when seeing Glen & Marketa perform, it was magic.
In addition to the distillery itself there is a comfortable tasting room (including some seating outside), a gift shop, and a small museum. Lebanon has only recently shown up on my radar. It's a lovely little town with a nice historic core. The big attraction for bourbon fans is Kentucky Cooperage, the Kentucky branch of Independent Stave, which makes most of the barrels for the bourbon industry. Lebanon is the seat of Marion County, which as the name suggests was founded by and still has a large Catholic population.

The secular reviewers of the Twilight series call it, “A dark romance that seeps into the soul.” The original title of Twilight was “Corpse,” but the publisher changed it to make it more appealing. The content of Twilight is in opposition to many Scriptures: it promotes sorcery, divination and witchcraft . Yet some church youth groups and “Christian” movie review sites suggest the relationship and sexual tension of two teenagers, one being a demonic vampire, draw parallels with Christian morals with lessons for the Christian to be found within the stories!

Matthew 6:33 But (A)seek first (B)the kingdom of God and his righteousness, (C)and all these things will be added to you. God instructs us to seek after Him alone and let tomorrow worry for itself as this goes against our very will. In hindsight, Jesus could be calling us to faith, trust,hope and love in him as it would take faith to cast away our worries for ourselves, endure the backlash from the world for doing what Christ says and to follow a God that the world hates.
The Tower already exists.
The den. This is mostly my husband's space that we designed and decorated when he was bishop, so that he could have people over to talk. But I like that it has that kind of history. It has become, since that time, the refuge. When the kids come in they are a little more careful to keep it clean and to even speak a little lower. We write in here. We sing and record in here. We read and gather our thoughts.

That didn’t mean I was done, though! I had a coffee, and with the coffee came some wonderful macarons, petit fours and chocolates:
Simone’s favorite movies at the moment are Meet the Fockers (it’s a long story) and The Muppet Movie (although when the frog bounty hunter shows up near the end, she gets scared and asks me to switch it off). Her favorite book is King Bidgood’s in the Bathtub. We’ve both been digging the Danger Mouse faux spaghetti western soundtrack Rome. It’s killer: the best soundtrack to a nonexistent movie, ever. It’s one of the only albums she doesn’t switch off after a few minutes.
I used Staz-on Midnight Blue ink. I still thought I might draw patterns at this point, and I don't like to mix blacks, so I went with the dark blue. Staz-on is waterproof, and I knew I'd be adding more water.

“I heard that, Mel.” Betty said in pretended annoyance as she came back in the room. “There he goes again,” she continued, talking to me now, “He always likes to pretend like he’s all high and mighty, but inside all that toughness, he’s just a big baby.”
Check back the week of Feb 1 for more details!
I wanted gold-colored handles to tie in with the cabinet handles and the general color scheme of the room. I was debating between drop pulls and ring pulls and decided to go with ring pulls in the end, although I think either would have looked nice. I found some nice round brass ring pulls from Lee Valley.
I was pleased with my results and then I started my hunt for paper. Ordinarily I pick out my papers first and then color. I'm really not sure why I didn't do that this time but I really couldn't find any papers in my stash that were worthy of such a beautiful image. (Actually, I couldn't find any that matched!) That meant having to go to Enchanted Cottage on my lunch break to see what I could find. Well, I found three papers that I thought would make a lovely combination so I bought them and as soon as I got home from work, I hit my stamp room determined to make another "Fran-tage" beauty. The more I looked at the pink patterned paper from Creative Imaginations, the more I wanted to use the touching "Hope" message printed there. I'm a cancer survivor so this is something near and dear to my heart. I cut out my image and started playing around with the paper but I just couldn't get it configured in a manner I felt was right for "Fran-tage." I had cut my base to be a 6" square from Bazzill. I cut my bottom layer of patterned paper from Creative Imaginations in a 5 3/4" square. I cut two strips of the green Karen Foster patterned paper about an inch wide and I then edged each strip with a Martha Stewart punch. From my Creative Imaginations "Hope" paper I cut my middle panel to fit the word across the bottom section. I adhered the punched strips to each side of the top layer and centered both top and bottom layers on my base. In order to add some texture to my image, I added some of the new fresh green and lavender crushed glass glitters from Stampendous! I used glossy accents to hold my glitter on and as soon as it was dry enough, I pop-dotted my image onto the card. I added a little sheer pink ribbon with a pearl as an accent. I chose the pearl because even with something as small as a grain of sand irritating the oyster, something as beautiful as a pearl can grow. There are many things in life that irritate us but we can still radiate beauty from within if we choose to. I would like to think that because of my cancer, I'm now able to see more of the beauty in life around me. I still tend to rush through my days sometimes but I'm far more aware of my surroundings and of how blessed I am with God's grace to still be here. So, without further ado, here's my card. I hope (no pun intended) that you like it.
We will compete in the pair on Thur then fours for the rest of our time there. The focus has always been the same. Go as fast as you can in each boat and give the best showing for the work that has been done. We are still pre Christmas so I am not expecting any early presents but I am anticipating that we should be able to produce a number of good solid performances. I am not playing things down here rather being realistic about what needs to be done and how we set ourselves to continue and progress moving forward.
I walk through the rooms and halls and remember. Or try to remember. The kidadults are upset. This is their childhood home. This is our past. Our history. Their height markers are still on the doorjambs of their bedroom closet doors. How tall they have become. How small they once were.

I, like most Americans who’ve taken time to listen to the choruses of unending diatribe coming from these people, notice that it’s remarkably the same screed coming from group to group, wherever these people congregate… if it can be called a message. It’s actually more of a melange of regurgitated Marxist claptrap. Right from the mouths of leftist agitators, college and university professors, even high school and grade school teachers. This is what our billions and billions of education dollars purchased.

Spring is a beautiful time of the year in Brisbane with Jacarandas blooming throughout the city. It’s a very colourful display that leave beautiful lavender sprinkles on the ground. This is without a doubt my favourite tree.
However a further point to be clarified is that the mere appearance of contradiction between two statements (either Qur’an or Sunnah) is not sufficient to claim abrogation. There must be a divine evidence to state that the abrogation is actually relating to the abrogated. There must be a clear context concerning the occurrence of the abrogation. There are a number of incidents where two, apparently contradicting revelations where implemented in total compatibility. Concerning the above verses from At-Taubah they should be understood without abrogation.
They cite example of farmers, like Papamma, who have already started a second green revolution. Her house is full of vegetation. Not an inch of waste land around Papamma�s house or farm can be spotted. �Do you see the black sprinkles on the leaves and the beans? That is cow dung water I sprinkled to avoid pests,� says the 60-year-old Papamma who lives in D. Kurubarahalli, a remote village in Kolar, nearly 90 KM from Bangalore.
Otherwise – do rush out and buy the newie from The Caretaker as it is fantastic; do play Ramesses very loud; and don’t forget if you are ever feeling down you can always turn to The Monkees for support.
‘For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!’ Galatians 2.19-21 NIV.
So they dug all day
Well, and I admitted to have left matches in one of the bags and they wanted me to take them out. Since they might explode, I guess. They also asked me to remove the disconnected battery, which I did assuming I would have to get a replacement in the USA (annoying, but it wasn’t like I could ride away), but instead it was taped inside a box and strapped to the seat, with bungie cords. Not really sure what that was supposed to accomplish, other than making it more likely to spill.
And then came The Dark Ages. We shall not speak of them in depth. Suffice it to say that during this period of about eighteen months, many not-nice things happened in my life. My house was flooded. My editor turned down my third book. Family members became ill. *I* became ill. And while I kept writing through this, it was to very little effect. I didn't finish anything, and every time that I nearly did, my agent or my publisher didn't like it.
For Theo he says,”As we already know, Theo Walcott will also miss the Carling Cup Final after being stretchered off in the same game. Again, the problem may be relatively short term. I saw him this morning, he has a classic ankle sprain. We don’t think there is any more damage to it. But it is still a sprain. We are sad for him too. He is out for Sunday and maybe one or two more weeks.”

Lets look at this time last year: Alicia packed up Peter and forcibly moved him to a new apartment, then got in a hotel elevator with Will on the way to open the doors on their long-thwarted passion. Now that’s the kind of cliffhanger that has you marking the days until the show returns in the fall.

This is all about what I choose to make – as I said prophetically in my first post, “I’m not so well known and in demand, that I can just make what I like and sell it – I will have to have an eye on what my public will like, and what they would be prepared to pay”

This blog post doesn’t intend to give solutions to these problems but only a roundup of what we obviously have right now. I don’t blame those who go outside the country to work, it’s a solution and they made that decision. I’m just a bit concerned if they are not treated well or have been captives of war.

The explosions happened hours after Obama left Afghanistan after a quick visit to mark the first anniversary of Usama bin Laden’s death. He spoke to troops and signed a pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to govern the U.S. presence in Afghanistan through 2024.
Bake the quiche in a preheated 350 degree oven until it is golden brown on top and the center is no longer liquid. This will take anywhere between 45 minutes to an hour depending on your oven. Just start checking it at 45 minutes. You'll notice as it cooks that it begins to puff up a bit. It will deflate once it comes out of the oven but the "puff" is a good way to tell which areas are cooked and which are still liquid.
Rather than a laundry list of legislation that Americans want repealed, suffice it to say that his major legislative initiatives are widely regarded as weakening the economy while growing the government. In this he has been abetted by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, along with brain-dead Democrats in Congress who clearly did not bother to read the bills before voting on them.

Two family members recently asked me if I was still alive. They follow this blog to stay updated on my life and apparently the fact that I haven't updated this in a month leads to concern in the family about my well being. So this is just a quick update to say that yes, I'm still alive. Yes, everything is fine. No, I haven't died or fallen off the face of the earth. I've just been really busy.

In 1992, Lenny produced an album for the French singer Vanessa Paradis on which he played most of the instruments and wrote several lyrics. In 1993, Kravitz wrote "Line Up" for Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. Together with Mick Jagger, he recorded a new version of "Use Me" for Jagger's album 'Wandering Spirit'. Lenny also worked with Al Green and Curtis Mayfield.
The first voice came from the man on the left. “That is right. Kneel before us. Worship us, for we are greater than your God.” His voice rang out with good-natured jocularity. Peter felt sure that his face was covered to hide a visage totally out of place in this den of evil men.
I recently saw an article on umpteen ways to avoid overwhelm. Just looking at that article made me feel overwhelmed! So, let’s do them one at a time. You can start to move forward today, and feel like you are doing SOMETHING to improve how you feel and where you are. If on the other hand, you are currently doing this practice, you can check it off your mental box, and feel GREAT.
In fact, I'm usually just the opposite. I'm high. I'm exhausted and spent. My body is damp and smells bad. But I'm feeling good. Really, really good. Because I'm strong. My muscles have worked hard and done their job. My body has done what it was created to do, and done it in a very efficient way. I'm happy and grateful to be healthy. I'm thrilled to be smelly and tired.
The Uncle Eric books and study guides (written by Richard Maybury) look like an interesting way to begin formal economics. Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? covers basic economics. Money Mystery is the next step in the series, covering career, business and investments. Clipper Chip Strategy covers the economics of business specifically. Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career & Financial Security covers the basic belief systems, or models, we base our decisions on; these decisions underly economics (we may begin with this book as it is the foundation for the series). Each book also has a study guide that goes along with it.
Anyhoo, one or two of you asked about my issue with ribbons and bows (yesterday's post), well I can't do them. It makes no difference how hard I try, how carefully I place the ribbon and/or bow, they simply do not look as if they are part of the card - they just look plonked on as an afterthought. I guess I'm simply not a girl for excess frippery.
We’re wrapping on the series and so far Hae Ra has only been using passive-aggressive tactics against Mi Roo. While the other characters are really reflecting on their own needs and motives, Hae Ra’s been largely ignorant of it. I think Mi Roo’s been very good about trying to keep her distance from Jin Oh. Is it her fault that he remembered her birthday? I know that Hae Ra loves Jin Oh but is forcing him to love her really going to make her happy in the end?

Then there were the white balance and exposure controls. You're limited by the gamut of the film itself and whatever colors it can give you. While you can choose your film for its color profile and even use filters to alter the color at any given time, you're still limited by the color gamut available in the chemicals of the film itself. With RAW, your gamut and exposure range is at least 10 times or greater than that of film- there's just no comparison the brightness and saturation that you can achieve in digital compared to film. Strike 5 against film.
Be the Gods and Goddesses, the Kings and Queens you all are. Know that you are special, but no more so than any other. Use your power wisely and rule yourself with a feather, not a whip. Be wise, be compassionate, be understanding when another asks you a question that may seem mundane or trivial to you. Kindness that was shown to you, show to others. Judge not lest you are prepared to judge yourself for it later. Reach out to all of us when you feel the need to, but know that the best guidance you need or seek, is to be found within or close at hand through the Spirit Guides you chose for yourself. I can, we can, answer your questions but we ask you to remember, we speak in God Code as well. Till next time I would like to thank David for taking the time out of his busy schedule with God to share this with you.
Oh, by the way, ASA's decision to ban it is in fact even more ridiculous than for the reasons outlined above.

Rivars says he’ll soon get positive evidence about what Par-Chavorlem is up to. He’ll get it to Gary who will turn it over to Symvoret. Par-Chavorlem appoints Gary as interpreter for Symvoret with instructions to translate in such a way that it’s favorable to the administration. Symvoret offers him a huge land grant on another planet for Gary to interpret correctly. The fourth element are Gary’s fellow interpreters. They think he’s a spy for the administration. Two of them want Gary’s girfriend Elizabeth to kill Par-Chavolem or else they’ll kill Gary.

We raced around catching up with long lost friends and going to an engagement party. I took the baby quilt I made last week to give to the parents-to-be and they loved it. I think I may have gained a few orders too.

Finally was the Supplication. As I said in the Russian River Rumble, this is my favorite of the available sours and it didn't change after having all five of these. It has an inviting sour cherry nose and the flavors are a nice balance of fruit and sour. Unlike the currants in Consecration, the cherries have a noticeable and delicious presence that I really enjoy. Jo liked this one the most as well and is now asking how much cases cost so that's a huge endorsement.
But just in the last week I’ve come across some great examples that have really stayed with me.

Inside the strategically placed jar of evil (added for dramatic effect), are gourmet gummi bears that are regularly supplied by our Top Administrator through the ordering of 5 lb bags on a regular basis. It’s apparently a vice for her, and as vices go… you start out getting them for free, but eventually everyone pays, one way or another! As I notice the fluctuating level of gummi bears in this jar throughout the day… apparently those gummi bears are the “crack” of the candy world!

Even with this 'studio' dining room set-up, I'm still cramped in terms of space. My HUGE, most-frustrating challenge!! Since my light is limited in it's reach, I'm really limited in the span of the shots I can take. Which is why most of my photos are close-ups. I don't have the opportunity to take shots with wide spans, gorgeous back-drops and backgrounds, or fully-set tables and place settings.
Now I didn’t want the top piece to stay exposed and I didn’t want fabric on the top, because I was afraid it would get dirty and since I would be stapling it on I wouldn’t be able to remove it and wash it.
First, let me say that when you are running along side a bike and a Rip Stick, you just naturally run a little faster. So I was feeling pretty good about this little family exercise outing. And then my son challenged me to a race going uphill on his Rip Stick.

Scorching sand burned at her feet and bitterness ate at her heart. Mellie pumped her legs as fast as they would go. Her feet pounded with the rhythm of her emotions, beating a tempo with the crashing waves. Run-a-way. Run-a-way. Run-a-way. Adrenaline pulsed through her veins, quickening her step.

Teach us your ways and lead us down the plain, uncomplicated path of truth for your name’s sake.
The game show has been a lost art form in Australia having been replaced with oversized scratchies (Deal Or No Deal) or hyperactive nonsense (Millionaire Hotseat) which makes Letters & Numbers appearance all the more enjoyable. While Channel 7 were forcing contestants to catch ping pong balls in a box strapped to their butt SBS were getting back to basics with a local version of the UK’s Countdown. Letters & Numbers isn’t flashy, but it doesn’t have to be; it’s still the best game show on TV.

*The messages. While a jumbles mess, the messages were still good ones to take on and I am glad someone is trying to get them out there. Drunk driving (and underage drinking in general!), gay rights, learning not to be so shallow and judgmental of people. All very good things to get out to teens.
I shrugged a little. "Others might not agree with me, but I think all promises are equal. What I mean is that some promises might be bigger than others, but they're all important, and once someone makes a promise, it's important to keep those promises as much as possible. Sometimes things will happen that might keep someone from keeping a promise, but that person still needs to make an effort. That's part of integrity."

Most remarkable of all is that Northern Scotland (57ºN latitude) was almost the last to be hit. Throughout November, temperatures remained a balmy 50ºF. Even (spring-flowering) gorse burst into bloom. It recalled an equally abnormal episode in April this year, where temperatures in the same corner of Scotland hit all-time highs.
I met my friend Nester for coffee the other day. We always say we are going to meet for coffee, but actually its just to grab a cup, talk as fast as we can about 9,000 different things before we run out, jump in one of our cars, and then hit the thrifts stores. I love going thrifting with Nester. We walk in together, split apart, meet back up, show each other what we found, try on clothes, and then I always model something for her to get her honest opinion, which she will always give. We talk, share, dream, usually repeating things over and over because we are easily distracted by all the junk just screaming to be taken home! When I leave our thrifting adventures I always feel so happy, almost giddy. I guess its spending time with a dear friend doing something that I love. Thrifting is my therapy. Digging though all that junk, the hunt, the projects that come to mind, the dreaming up ideas from different cast off pieces, it just fills me up. But also to thrift with someone you love spending time with who also appreciates the hunt, well that is just about the best thing.
It’s unsurprising that Gleave is thinking in terms of the long-game, considering it’s taken him eight years to come up, unencumbered by hype, on pop’s inside track. In 2006, the first incarnation of Example emerged – as a semi-novelty, sample-reliant rapper from the mean streets of Fulham (less street, more cul-de-sac) who was the last act signed to Mike Skinner’s ill-fated vanity label, The Beats.

I have something that I need to say to you, however, I'm not so sure I'm ready to say it yet. I need some time to digest the truth of what it is and figure out how I'm going to say it so that it doesn't sound too crazy. It may take a while for me to do this. I'm working on it. My therapist is helping me, but I haven't gotten there yet. I will. Hopefully I will do so soon.

None of this should be surprising. In a global marketplace, there is a strong incentive to cut the cost of labor, either by outsourcing production or by insourcing workers. This two-way process will continue until wage rates are more or less the same throughout the world. So it doesn’t matter how low the wages are in labor-importing countries. What matters is whether the wages are even lower in labor-exporting countries. Such is the logic of globalization.
Especially when the peach ice cream is nestled inside a lovely waffle cone. This has been one of my favorite sweet treats lately. I think the peachness of it makes me think it's summer time. Somehow, I never get to finish the entire portion of ice creamy goodness all by myself. I have a little boy whose eyes light up when he sees me walking into the room with it and suddenly any toy he was playing with is forgotten.
Day 2 we relaxed at home on a rainy day and let the girls watch movies and make cupcakes. We also did a bike riding tour of the Stanford Campus (put on by Jen). The campus is magnificent. I loved all the architecture and green foliage.

The other day, after the Florida primary, I heard possibly the greatest political metaphor I've ever heard, in reference to Newt Gingrich's reasoning behind staying the Republican primary race.
15. The brain operates on the same amount of power as 10-watt light bulb. The cartoon image of a light bulb over your head when a great thought occurs isn’t too far off the mark. Your brain generates as much energy as a small light bulb even when you’re sleeping.

Sec. 1021, the bill’s discretionary detention provision, authorizes the President to detain persons who “substantially supported” forces “associated” with al-Qaeda or the Taliban that “are engaged in hostilities” against the U.S. or its “coalition partners.” None of the quoted terms are defined. We do not know what constitutes substantial support, hostilities, or our coalition partners. Critically, the bill does not attempt to define “associated forces,” either. Without knowing what qualifies as an associated force, no one can be sure they are safe from the government’s detention.
My immediate reactions was likely similar to those of everyone else--run a quick inventory of the family. Where were they and did they know? I called my recently widowed mother who was angry and frightened. As soon as I felt she was calm I began calling the kids, and the the unthinkable happened. The Pentagon!

This morning the horizon is dark grey in the north - whether from fire or rain we cannot yet tell. There is a touch of moisture on the wind although I cannot smell that magical rain smell. But then I am not an elephant. We pass one heading directly towards the dark sky, the rhythm of his steady pace belying his traveling speed. A flock of open bill storks pass overhead in classic V formation heading the same way. Their wings flicker white against the dark clouds.

There is a spin that Gordon Brown like other people will say things that they don't really mean. So, Labour spinners are actively saying that the Prime Minister is disingenuous as a defence to a worse perception. It is truly so very disappointing that this is the man who already leads us, and that Labour supporters are paying their subs for an army of spin masters who must go on television to make excuses for Brown. If the Prime Minister was lacking in frankness and sincerity in that interview, and his cheer-leaders are shouting this fact from the rooftops; then why should we ever believe a single word he ever has to say?

But last Thursday at the required public meeting with the Beachside Properties Inc, citizens held in their hands copies of the environmental reports and Ministry responses that were originally denied them – all thanks to the folks at the Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary who somehow managed to obtain copies of the reports and put them on the internet at their Chancery Lane – Long Beach resource page.

I have some of your clothes. Mom gave me your pajamas to wear when I spent the night, and the beige ones just aren't my style. I don't think they were yours, either. Bears on a man who made each different tartan his own? Exactly. I can't bring myself to do anything with them, toss them or give them to an unknown who might not appreciate who you were. I was across the country when you died, and part of me worries that I'll be discarding what you wore when you told K you were glad she'd made the trip safely, when you last fell asleep with Mom making sure you'd taken those pills. You'd think this was no big deal, put them in a bag already, but I can't do it, and I can't bring myself to ask her which pair they were. It wouldn't be fair. Some of these clothes are still in a bag in my hallway. I caught Cricket laying on them, right there in the upright suitcase, and I love that she did, because you would have gotten a kick out of it. I would have called you to tell you, 30 seconds of nothing of consequence punctuated by a giggle, and we would have said our goodbyes. Until the next silly thing happened. I think about calling you like this a lot, particularly with each and every dumb pun I know would get a laugh and a shake of your head. It still takes a few seconds to realize it just can't happen.
The issue carries the coverline “Catherine Middleton, the making of a modern princess” and looks back at the magazine’s 95-year history of covering royal weddings.
Here’s the deal. Even if the Lord says directly (or rather, most indirectly via several translations from original texts) that we are to spread the Word – I would say that we have something to consider: Why would the Lord say this? Isn’t the Lord the Alpha and the Omega? He is the beginning and the end and everything in between! Any one of his creatures will know this!
Apart from redistribution, which enables blacks to secure loans to buy or lease land from the government, the land reform programme also includes restitution (state sanctioned theft), by which black communities recover ancestral land.

Looking back, I know I made a great choice for me and my baby as far as our birth plan. I would absolutely recommend Hypnobirthing to ANYONE, and for first time moms, I wouldn’t read ANYTHING before you’ve read the Hypnobirthing book. Much of the literature, online reading and videos available can cause a lot of unneccessary fear. Yes, you will probably have some aprehension regardless, as this is a complete unknown, but it doesn’t have to be the “scary experience” our society often makes it out to be. No matter what kind of birth you want, you and your baby can benefit from this method. Those who casually say “oh we’re going to try to do it naturally but we’ll see how it goes” are usually not mentally prepared for the challenge. For women who would really like to have a natural birth, you have to go into it with a completely dedicated mindset and an understanding of what is going on, as well as a supportive birth team that knows your wishes! I can’t say enough how important it was that we had Dawn the doula for support, and our midwife and the hospital staff on board (with a copy of our written birth plan in hand)! You CAN do this! I will do it all over again the next time around…and I’m actually very excited about round 2!

I am now refusing to cook in my kitchen. I have thrown a lot of our food away. And I will only eat items from the fridge. Each time I nervously enter the kitchen, I mentally prepare myself, make sure I'm not holding anything breakable, and I shout loudly and clap to give them a chance to at least run away and hide so that I don't have to see them strolling around on my kitchen surfaces.
At long last Blonde Redhead took to the stage. Wearing a white wisp of a dress matching her dainty demeanor, the arrestingly attractive Kazu Makino and equally stunning identical twin Italian brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace commanded immediate attention as they delved into the slow-burning “Black Guitar” off their latest effort, Penny Sparkle. Featuring vocal parts by both Amedeo and Kazu, the song took on a theatrical air backdropped by cool blue stage lights and dense fog-machine clouds as the two floated around each other during the vocal tradeoff.

Sleep eluded me as I tried to struggle with a bad cold and cough. In the middle of the night the cool breeze relaxed my restless heart and tired body. I tried to sit up and work on the lappie but somehow did not have the strength. The drumbeat in the cell indicated a text message. There are times when the heart is torn between longing and loss. It’s an emotion which can’t be really described. Tears know not for what reason they flow. My vision blurred I slid out of bed and went to the terrace. Apart from a constant hum of the refrigerator the entire house was bathed in silent glow of the night-light. I still believe that heartstrings are tuned irrespective of physical distances and unseen heard melodies are the ones that make life worth what it is.
The very first post I wrote for this blog almost 5 years ago was called Aiming Low and was about marketers' unrelenting stupidity at targeting young people in advertising.
Roll out dough between two sheets of lightly floured baking paper until 3mm thick. Use a 4cm (1½in) cookie cutter to cut out cookies. Use a paring knife to trim stray bits of cranberry from edges – if the dough gets too soft, place it in the freezer for 5 minutes. Place cookies onto prepared sheets, 5cm (2in) apart, and bake until lightly golden on the edges, about 20 minutes.

Place the chicken in a pan and cover with the buttermilk , 2 tsp. salt and nice dose of hot sauce; allow to set covered in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours , overnight even better. Remove chicken and allow to drain over wire rack set in pan. Combine the flour ,pepper and season salt ; whisk to combine. Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off excess flour. In a large frying pan add the lard and heat until melted on medium heat. Add vegetable oil if needed to fill pan no more then half way. Oil is ready when a handle of a wooden spoon placed in the oil bubbles. Add the chicken , but do not over crowd pan. Fry about 10 minutes per side until golden. Remove to a rack to drain when finished.

“Never mind,” I said walking back to the freezer to put away the orange juice. I learned my lesson long ago about those small and inconspicuous, non-bank affiliated ATM’s which charge anywhere from five dollars or higher for their use. Santorum clone kept smiling like a pleasantly dressed but maniacal serial killer as I walked out leaving me with a slight concern for my safety but an overwhelming urge to wash my hands for some reason.
Over the next three days, I learned how to be a mama of babies in the NICU. I learned about beeps and alarms and three-hour schedules. I saw the names on the isolettes and knew those were my babies. I saw their daddy's nose on their tiny, raw faces and knew those were my babies. I was pumping my breast milk every two hours around the clock to give to my babies. But it was a very intellectual experience. My brain knew those were my babies.

While I was sitting in a suite tonight, waiting for a search warrant to go through, I just kept thinking about the song, “For the Moments I Feel Faint” by Relient K. It was a big song for me in high school. The only line I could remember of the song was a part of the chorus, “You’re telling me that there’s no hope; I’m telling you you’re wrong.” I had a thought, have I been telling myself that there’s no hope? I’ve been known to do so, when I get in a bad enough mood.

But not all initiates make it into the Dauntless faction. Only the bravest. Only the strongest. Only the best. Readers follow Tris (Beatrice) on her new journey. We meet fellow initiates--those born Dauntless, and those transferring from other factions. We follow their training through three stages. They will be challenged physically, mentally, and emotionally. We become familiar with their two trainers--Eric and Four. We see the faction's strengths and weaknesses. As does Tris. On the one hand, Tris realizes she is fierce. She can be strong, determined, brave. She is learning to face her fears, learning to face life. But she's also realizing that compassion and love are part of courage. That selflessness has prepared her for her new life. On the other hand, she sees how heartless, how cruel some are. Yes, the Dauntless have their flaws.
I made sure I read during both my break 15mins and lunch 30mins, with the exception of a few interruptions. The result is that (at 4.30pm GMT) I've now read 23 pages of 'Crusade of Tears' by C.D. Baker in half an hour.

If you’ve liked early books by Berkom, you are sure to enjoy this one even more. This is one of the longer books by Berkom and has good pace balance throughout. As with all her books, this is another great value for the money. And although reading previous Kate Jones books will give context to “Touring for Death” this is really a stand alone chapter in the ongoing saga and readers new to Berkom can easily start with this novel and not miss a beat.

I have also missed worship. Some of the songs really resonate with me and often bring me to tears. This weekend was no exception. In fact, I'm including the lyrics to Before the Throne of God because it is an absolutely beautiful song and describes the love of God in a way that just grabs hold of my heart.

I feel bad that I’ve preached and preached about waiting for the right guy. Maybe I have and Peter will surprise me. Who knows? I just know that I am not holding my breath for this casual tryst to magically turn into a relationship. I still do believe that whether or not a woman is a virgin, she should decide when, where, and with whom she should sleep with. This was the best option for me and I do not regret it. I don’t recommend it to everyone. A part of me wishes that I decided to have sex when I was younger, but I know that I wouldn’t have been able to handle it the way I have now. All I know is that since I’ve lost my virginity, this huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I no longer have this secret. I am no longer the “adult virgin”. I am just Valerie. I can strip off the labels and live the way that I want to. That weekend was for me and no one else.

With this said, I must certainly apologize for the miscommunication generated by the server at your table. She misrepresented the Eat The Whole Menu at The Bent Brick which unfortunately ruined for you what has historically been an epically great experience for all of the guests who have ordered it. Apparently your server led you to believe that we strongly encourage large parties to Eat The Whole Menu. This is not the the point that should have been communicated. We like our customers to order however they wish to order. It's certainly fun for large parties to Eat The Whole menu but how our customers enjoy our menu is entirely up to them.

Living in a world filled with so much bad and ugliness, it is refreshing to be reminded about someone who is truly and totally good and beautiful…in nature as well as in action. In his book, The Good and Beautiful God, the author, James Smith, reminds us of the fact that there is someone in our world who is good and beautiful and that person is God. In his book he does a masterful job at explaining for us just how GOOD and BEAUTIFUL God really is.

For anyone who hasn't read Danny's articles, here's the brief overview. Deadly Premonition is a third-person detective story by Japanese designer Hidetaka "SWERY 65" Suehiro, released in the US back in February. Sold at the budget price of $19.99, it was both panned and lauded by reviewers. It's gained cult status not only due to the polarizing responses it's provoked, but also because of its unrelentingly strange and oddly charming Twin Peaks-esque story and characters.

Last week, when someone dropped me off on the way to the Church office, he was saying that Paul and Timothy had such a good relationship that they looked out for each other and making sure the churches were ok. Especially in times of persecution and oppression. We were talking about a whole different topic but I thought about this later and applied this to our students too and wondered about how we can pull this into helping them to step out into faith. It’s definitely not an easy task to dictate.
Back in the dawn of time (somewhere in the 1990's I think), my Corporate Job Place was built, and some time later, an addition was added to it in order to make navigation more difficult. The ceiling is between 15 and 40 feet high in this particular cubicle farm, with padded grayish-cream colored cubicles set in neat little rows (they are the color of old lady teeth). They are a bit over five feet high, so if I stand on my tippy-toes, I can see the foreheads of other people walking around in the alleys between cubes. I am very good at identifying my coworkers by their foreheads.

Have you ever thought about becoming a real estate paralegal? And not only a real estate paralegal, but a commercial real estate paralegal? Good for you! I found that a real estate deal has a life unto itself and coming to the closing is in some ways similar to approaching the finish line of a corporate challenge marathon. You prepared and practiced for many days; you ran and came to the finishing line. The only difference is that after the award ceremony, there is more work to be done.

If my car doesn’t have everything working properly I get a moving violation and the police are all over it. I find it hard to beleive that a municipal police force would willingly and knowingly allow a cruiser on the streets with a broken video camera.
It is with great pleasure that I give you a look behind the scenes of the most challenge yet most fun photoshoot I’ve had to date. It should come as no surprise since I’m a Porsche enthusiast and Flying Lizard fan that I jumped at the opportunity to work with the team. It all started with some discussions during the off season, then a few months ago the head of PR/marking got in touch with me about a photo shoot concerning images for Le Mans. What I didn’t know at the time were the constraints I would be facing for the shoot.

Description and History – There is little left of this canal side church but it boasts a long history. A church was originally located here in the 8th century when Irish monks were establishing many communities in the area. The present structure is late medieval and may not have had a long period of usage as the Penal Laws brought an end to Catholic worship here as it did to many other churches throughout Ireland. The present church is badly ruined and measures 16m x 7.5m. The E and W walls survive to full height but the N wall has collapsed in recent years destroying very fine Latin inscribed gravestone underneath it. The graveyard contains some very nice gravestones.

So what does this have to do with legalization of drugs? Where is the connection? Here is my position. You can legalize one drug, but you cannot legalize them all. The industry will simply reinvent itself. Not to mention the prison industrial complex is driven by this industry as well. There is simply to much “legal” money tied to illegal activity.

Anyway, Sunday night we were contemplating our drive back to Florida on Monday. It's not such a bad drive-- about 8 hours.

It is, though, a little bit strange that Middle Eastern governments, some of whom have been having a tough time lately, have been quite so generous to Western (and particularly British) universities. A few weeks ago Christopher Davidson (reader in Middle East politics at Durham University) tackled this question in the Times Higher Educational Supplement. He wrote of the "fascination in many of the Gulf monarchies ... with spending vast sums on overseas education projects, even if the domestic sector is left to languish."
What exactly is our national security securing? Certainly not our liberty. We have been sacrificing ever larger chucks of our liberty to the gods of security for decades now and in the interests of securing our liberty have given it all away. Go to an airport if you want to witness the loss of liberty in all its glorious humiliation. One wonders if we actually were taken over by another power and our Constitution dismantled what exactly could they do to restrict our movements, monitor our activities and control our actions that would be any worse or oppressive than what our own government is doing right now?

I have one fella chasing another fella who has left office after work, with no 'message' on what's going on, the chasing fella is jumping high and low as he / she couldn't get things done...
The old man charges after him. “I had a visitor today…. Jamshid Mohammed! What the hell are you playing at?”
Again, this is a mix of new titles and some that I've been after for a while, as well as being a mixture of 'gritty' realism and contemporary humour - sometimes in the same book.
All-in-all then, it is probably best to stick with standard domestic livestock for normal day-to-day travel, preferably a jersey cow, as these tend to have more optional extras when compared to the basic Friesian. For the wannabe boy racers, of course, there are plenty of breeds of domesticated pigs, from the hot miniatures right through to the swill-guzzling road hogs, for them to choose from.
The show is a minefield of symbols -- Michelangelo, Picasso, Magic Eye books, Buddha, a crab, automotive repair advertising, and what may or may not be a fish head. Each of these could compel a witty exhibition, and I genuinely believe that that is what Johnson is trying to do, be as witty as he can while at the same time taking his thought and work in deeper directions. After all, humor often surprises with the quality of its critique. You would expect nothing less from a former student of Charles Ray. Artists like Tom Friedman and Ray do this very well in their work, and Johnson seemingly drew close to their respective practices in his first show.
but my favorite is from Canadian author Margaret Atwood:
If DC really wants to appeal to non-fanboys with the New 52, it would behoove them to have an entry level title that the casual reader can pick up every now and then and get a satisfying single issue reading experience. If this debut issue is any indication, Superman might just be that title. This would be appropriate, since everyone knows who Superman is. He's not only DC's most famous character, but one of the most recognizable fictional characters in all of literature. Therefore, you don't really need to spend a lot of time introducing the characters to new readers. If you were in a comics shop about to pick up your first ever comic book, wouldn't you be more likely to go for a character you already know from movies and TV?
Tettiz is extremely lazy and could spend whole evenings on the sofa watching television. She loves to bake even though she's on a diet. She just has her husband and daughter eat what she makes. She's afraid of snakes. She's obsessive about the kitchen in her house. If the rest of the house is a mess, the kitchen's almost always clean. She was named Jeanette because she was her father's (Jan) first child (one = ett in Swedish). She teaches English and Swedish in H.S. She loves the color yellow and her new yellow beetle says RAW on the license plate. That rocks!
3. What is your favorite cookbook? I love the simplicity of Rachael Ray’s cookbooks – I have every one. Her style is true to my Italian roots, and even when she’s making meals that aren’t Italian in nature, per se, they remind me of the way my mom cooked for us every night when we were little. Hearty and healthy meals. I also love Giada’s recipes. And my sister swears by the recipes she gets from her Sunset cookbooks. Lately, I’ve been pulling a lot of recipes from Eating Right magazine.

I'm not a spokesman for it but you can see it in action with Martha Stewart in the driver's seat. What I really like is how easy it is to clean. No sharp blades just this big heavy grinding 'screwdriver block' that crushes the fruits, veggies, nuts or whatever. The juice goes into the right container while the pulp goes into the left one. Definitely no regrets getting it.
When we test a digital ad, a print ad or a package on-line, we typically use timed exposures of ½ seconds, 1 second, and 4 seconds to measure what elements of an ad are being recorded in working memory.
My first daughter couldn’t join us as she had school. Bummer! Because of the bad traffic, we decided to head back to Jakarta without seeing the wonderful shows you can see at the zoo. That was also a bummer for us. M, J, H and K, Thanks for visiting us in Jakarta!!
This was going to be my April teaser, but the last couple of weeks were busy with the Merola Opera Program’s annual Benefit Gala, A Royal Affair (there are Mélanie and I above in our tiaras). So the April teaser is being posted in early May. It’s a scene from the novella I’m writing about Malcolm/Charles and Mélanie/Suzanne’s engagement and wedding, provisionally titled The Lisbon Bride. In this scene, Charles/Malcolm tells his valet Addison that he’s going to be married. It’s fascinating for me to go back in time and discover who these characters I know so well were at the start of their relationship.
I'm honestly surprised I didn't see any of them wearing this:
Damodar asked, Hi Amit, Is there any particular etiquette to follow for a telephone interview?
If Craigslist refuses to spend any time and money to just make the surfing experience slightly better, what kind of message is that to its users? And most users do not have nearly the skill or know-how that they can make it a more pleasant experience by use of extensions. I can probably guarantee you that most users of Craigslist do not even know what browser they are using.
It made me look at how I had treated her son, at how The Man had viewed her son so differently than I had viewed him. It made me think about her daughter, so much like my own daughter, having to grow up without her mom. And how, as a mother she could so genuinely accept someone who had previously been cruel to her own son.
But it was real interesting because I got to talking about this experience with the silence, and the guy said, “Well, I’ll tell you something interesting. We do a lot of research on Caddo Lake.” Well, you know Caddo Lake. This is basically just a cypress swamp.

This has been a long time coming. I can't blame going back to work as it was already a problem beforehand. I can't even blame my daughter, as it was already a problem before she bounced into my life (erm, not literally).

My favorite of this set is the full body pose. Although it is a static pose, there is a feeling of fluidity and movement here. I just feel she knocked this pose outta the park and I'm pleased with my light and camera angle as well.
I don't know if you're getting where I'm going with this or not. I don't know if I know where I'm going with this.
Brody has gotten this dish many times before and raves about it. It includes crispy rice, sautéed spinach, winter vegetables, bean sprouts, sunny-side up egg, chili paste, and marinated tofu or pork. Mmmm…this was so good! I ate it all but saved room for dessert. My friend Rena and I chose the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake for the table to split, but after everyone else (four other people) took a bite, Rena and I polished it off. Oh, and my drink! While I don’t drink a lot of liquor, I do enjoy anything with gin and grapefruit juice. I ordered the Marquez Collins which obviously had those two liquids but then topped with red wine, all over ice. It was a lovely dinner experience, as it always is at Graze.
Where else you can see Sand Dunes, Ocean, Mountains and the City all at the same location?
We enjoyed the show until all the credits had rolled, but could not find a suitable place for dinner; the tourist season had yet to begin, so almost nothing was open. Instead, after a walk from one end of town to the other, we took the tram back to Sóller for a well-deserved dinner. We would head for Palma the following day, but for that evening we were happy to be living in the moment.
Issues of sex and gender aside, there’s a lot going on in this novel. The descriptions of Tokyo are wonderful. The descriptions of the suburbs and countryside surrounding Tokyo are also wonderful. The secondary characters are sympathetic and vividly portrayed. I loved Komatsu, and Ushikawa, and Professor Ebisuno, and Aomame’s friends Tamaki and Ayumi. The Dowager and Tamaru are a novel unto themselves. The allusions and parallels to political revolutionaries and religious cults in postwar and contemporary Japan are striking. The novel’s challenge to conventional notions of reality are intriguing. The connections between Murakami’s 1Q84 and Orwell’s 1984 (and in particular the transformation of “Big Brother” into “the Little People”) are fascinating.

A couple of nights ago Wesley and I sat down and read this book together. He was able to read a good chunk of it himself and seem to really enjoy it. Its based on the children's song "Five Little Ducks" excepts these cute little bunnies keep hopping away one at a time. The CD that is included in a slip pocket on the inside of the front cover contains the story read out loud by a narrator as well as 19 children's songs like
“I hope through my practices to honor the women, children and men who have lost their lives and who are struggling to survive now,” said Nancy, a resident of Roswell, Ga. “My daily journey will be much easier than theirs. But, I live in a society where people die from obesity and obesity related issues – we die from too much. They die from not enough…”
Those of you who were up there in Northrend with me will remember my last operation was at Light’s Hammer just inside the gates of Icecrown Citadel. You might also remember that I spent most of that time hanging out there with Tirion Fordring. Who I’d already had my fill of, by the way, when I went to meet him with Thrall at his stupid-ass tournament place. (Like seriously, isn’t ONE pansy-ass traveling fair enough for the world?) So hopefully you people were all too busy forging your way into the citadel and fighting our enemies like the Horde soldiers that you are…but meanwhile I was stuck back there with Tirion…who pretty much had nothing to do for a good long time but talk. And talk.

Looking around, in one corner are the “die-hards” who are still kicking on and you may even remember them from Friday night, but you would never go there! Sunglasses, nervous twitches and sideways glances – there is a slim chance that they have showered, and can let alone speak by this stage.
Start a school that teaches the ‘children of a lesser god’ for free, even better, pays the parents for sending the children to school.
What I’d really like to bake is some nice chocolate cupcakes with icing or a peach pie with some vanilla ice cream on the side. But alas, those things are now a distant memory. I’m not saying I’ll never eat those kinds of things again, but I can’t be having a whole batch of chocolate cupcakes or a whole peach pie in the house…I’d want to eat it all at once! And as hubby doesn’t really eat cakes or pies except on very rare occasions, it would just be me eating this stuff. Not a good thing.
It’s a fantastic chase sequence – imaginative and fun and aided by a rare GOLDENEYE appearance of the Bond theme, it’s the moment where Pierce Brosnan really becomes James Bond as it shows off Bond’s ability to improvise on the run and never lose his cool.
It wasn't one of the more visually or intellectually challenging pieces they've done on the show. But it was a visual feast. That final slow-motion bit was especially great.

J and I went for lunch here on my first day. After several minutes agonising over what to choose form the menu I decided on Green Tamales & Eggs for $11.75 described as ‘spinach corn tamales on a pool of tomatillo salsa topped with two eggs any style, avocado-tomato-cilantro salsa, toasted tortilla strips, sour cream and cilantro.’

Hendrix first looked deeper into marital psychology after his marriage ended in 1975. He thought the prevailing therapy of the time, loosely termed ‘conflict resolution’, focused too much on compromise. “What we found, and what the whole discipline of marital therapy in America found, was that it simply didn’t work, because a part of us is always resentful if we have to give things up,” he says. “Also, it was very cognitive – ‘there’s the problem, here’s the solution’. Like fixing a car. But people are not like machines.”

A plus point for me was that fantasy and magic play almost no role in the plot, much less than in the previous two books (This might explain in part why I thought In Winter’s Shadow the strongest of the trilogy). Gwalchmai still has his Otherworld sword and horse, but if they have any magical powers they are scarcely mentioned. Medraut is said to serve the ‘Darkness’, as his evil sorceress mother Morgawse did before him, but for the most part this could be taken as a metaphor for ordinary human vices such as cruelty and greed.

3 years later, she was invited by the company who produce Mr.Children. She wanted to manage them again but instead the company ask her to manage new group. She didn’t want to do other group so she left the company and look for the boys. Because the vocalist was dead, she did a talent search and found a rock band singer, Eugene. She tried to get Eugene to sing as a solo without his band, but he disagreed. Finally, she could get him by paying his nephew’s hospital fee for 24 months. She trained the boys very hard and with minimum cost. However, prior to debut Ji Oh (one of the boys) who has a bad temper suddenly attack the rival group from the other company (the company that previously employ Oh Gu Ju). Thus, she pulled back their debut time and instead debuting on a music program on TV they start singing for patients and disabled people. The response was great and Mr. Children starts to get popular.

Today, our Program Director, Sarah Rial, and I will make the 7000-mile trek to our partner Kurnyuk School for Girls in the world’s newest nation. It’s a grueling itinerary—6 hours from Boston to Amsterdam; 8 hours to Nairobi; 11 hour-layover before the 1.5 hour trip to Juba. We overnight in South Sudan’s boomtown capital, before taking the 1.5 hour flight to less cosmopolitan Wau; .5 hour jumper to even less “cosmo” Maluakon followed by the .5 hour drive over dusty, bumpy, potholed “road” to the Kurnyuk School located in quintessentially v-e-r-y rural Akon. Did I say the trip was grueling? Oh yes, and the temperatures average 106 degrees; the nighttime bugs can be fierce and latrines are often simple holes in the ground. That’s why our want ad reads, “Divas need not apply….”

I had to stand the husband in front of the microwave and ask him what he uses it for. He said, "Um, well, to heat things up. I just used it...the other week. Oh, well. To boil water?" He brought it in to work so other people can kill themselves slowly by using it. I Freecycled the toaster.

Anyway, we were all ready for bed around midnight, and hit the pillow and were asleep. CPT was awake and gone before I got up (to PT), and my alarm went off at 6:45am. The kids were SO excited to go in and see Grammie and Grandpa Harty. At 7am, right before Tom left for for school, I let them go in and see them. Joe needed his backpack and Jim needed his shoes (they were staying in their room). They were SO excited!!!

Cllr Peter John said: “Local councils are facing unprecedented cuts from the Tory/Lib Dem Government. We know that we’re going to have to change the way we work to rise to the challenge those cuts present and carry on making the improvements to local services that our residents need.

For my take, cans certainly have their advantages, and craft beer drinkers love their convenience and portability. Hopefully, the market will soon demand that Ball and its competitors come up with a way to manufacture effective BPA-free cans.

This was a trip that almost didn't happen. Flight prices were all over the place and just when I found a REALLY good deal (like $140 round trip) the prices shot up the next day and then a few days after that, the airline filed for bankruptcy and cancelled every flight until May! Every other airline was so expensive out of every city and I just became discouraged. That is, until I found a flight out of Grand Rapids, MI through AirTran. For about $220 round trip and with decent flight times. We've never flown out of Grand Rapids before but the airport will be really simple to get to and will be shorter drive than we're used to going to Detroit.
Anyhoo some fairly good news which i will be announcing either late this thursday or early friday may mean i increase my work load but also enjoyment in Sheffield and mean i see some of you bloggers, writters, or plain old beer enthusiasts a little more often.

Or I see a picture from high school. I remember walking down those paths lined with roses or crossing that lawn, going into that orchestra room, sitting on the steps of that gym. And you were there. You were always there. You are as much a part of that scene as the buildings in the background, I can’t think of that place without thinking of you, and how we were always together, as often as we possibly could be, because that was how much we loved each other.

I now realise there’s a bit of gap at the front of the shed, just underneath the diamond-shaped decoration that’s attached to the front of the pitched roof. You can’t see the gap, but I can put a few of my fingers through it. I had a quick look around for signs of nesting, I couldn’t see anything. I doubt that particular bird will return but it’s possible other birds will enter our shed during quiet months seeking refuge or looking for suitable nesting sites.

Anxiety and stress, often as the result of a traumatic life event, are sometimes the cause of nightmares and bad dreams. Not all nightmare triggers have to be traumatic, however. Everyday stressors, such as job or financial anxiety, or major life transitions such as moving or divorce, can also cause nightmares.

Despite the Academy Awards being a celebration of all things Hollywood, New York has actually hosted the Oscar ceremony on more than one occasion. Or rather, they co-hosted the event -- from 1953 to 1957 -- in a rare and soon abandoned bicoastal ceremony that taxed the mechanics of television's earliest production crews.
If one considers that the broadcasting rights of the IPL (Indian Premier League) were sold for US$ 1.026 billion and the brand is reportedly valued at US$ 4.13 billion, this may have been an error in judgement by ProBatter, unless of course the bowling application was never foreseen.

Calling on someone by name immediately grabs that person’s attention. It makes them aware of the individual’s intent to engage in a conversation or to offer up a cordial greeting. Our names give us identity, a sense of self-worth, and sometimes our names offer up clues as to our ethnicity, the place we come from, the type of person we are or want to be. Occasionally our names even come with titles that allude to our education or type of job we are enjoying. Names are essential to mankind’s community and communicating with each other within that community. And so it is with our Creator.

For the basecoat I used a very dark grey color, it´s called Antracita here. Really dark, no “blueish” tone whatsoever. After that I went with drybrush. You know this plastic minis have a very smooth surface. Metal minis usually have some texture, no matter how hard they try to make the part smooth. I don´t know if I´m making myself clear here. The point is that I did a very very detailed drybrush. By that I mean I used a small brush and went from a dark grey to a very light one. I did like 5 or 6 steps of grey (from dark to light)

Seriously, if anyone ever has seen her TV show, "Roseanne" a bulk of episodes deal with how the government does not understand or care about the middleclass. Even if she could only run for a lower government position, I believe she could do some good. he only thing I'd worry about is her getting support from the House of Senate and what not, since she does not want to run as Republican or Democrat. It's highly doubtful she could make it in the proper running, but it's definitely a nice thought.
I have two daughters, so I knew I was going to write a heroine. But I wanted the books to have a mythic quality, after all we’re talking about Templars and monsters and archangels. So I based Billi on the mythic heroines like Athene, like Boudica and the Rani of Jhansi, all powerful warriors as well as being female.
That’s why I am so bothered by the party’s recent loss of two up-and-coming Republicans: San Diego mayoral candidate Nathan Fletcher, currently a state assemblyman, and former assemblyman and current Congressional candidate Anthony Adams, both of whom left the party to become independents.

As you know, the frequency of the planet and of humanity’s energy signature is rising in preparation for the approaching New Age. The higher the frequency of an entity’s energy signature the more spiritually evolved that entity can become. A low frequency tends to be dense, almost leaden, and it is very difficult for Knowledge or Love to flow through it. Consequently, it is very difficult for beings whose frequency is low to communicate, and they get lost within themselves, rather like the proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand.

As Atlantic Yards Report suggests, she likely picked up her parlance directly from the developer. The Observer reports that Ms. Burden met with the developer/subsidy-collector Bruce Ratner only a few months before her remark. (See: Ratner Meets With Burden, by Matthew Schuerman, September 6, 2006) comments. According to that report Burden “wouldn’t give her own thoughts” but said of Ratner and Atlantic Yards “he did not mention scaling it back.”- (If you check your dates, the scaling-back reference is because this is exactly when the drama of the project’s faux size-reduction was taking center stage.)

Most American Colonists were English, so most Colonial homes are derived from English styles. The earliest were based on old medieval homes, easily identified by simple massing, a few small windows, and massive chimneys. The New England saltbox with its lower back roofline is a common adaptation of the medieval style; Dutch Colonials have similar massing but are distinguished by their distinctive gambrel roof style.

If the left doesn’t like what you have to say, they will ignore, demean, accuse without proof, libel, shout down discussion, ignore the talking points and create their own, accuse without proof using lawfare, create their own reality while ignoring facts to uphold their elitism, sue, and never, ever, debate face to face on neutral ground because that’s now how the left operates. Where the right would let the populace within a democracy decide their own fate, the left believes their point of view usurps the majority for their own good. Read the rest at Clay and WaterSun News is a bastion of free speech in Canada, and it is under attack for speaking the truth about islamic supremacist and leftist tyranny. There is an organized campaign to have the Canadian government shut them down, in yet another Orwellian push to stifle the voices of political dissent and silence those who stand for liberty.

A business owner’s policy (BOP) might be the perfect fit for your small business insurance needs. Make sure you understand exactly what is and what is not covered and if needed, secure additional coverage to fill in any gaps. By leveraging the cost savings provided by BOP coverage, businesses can ensure they have the protection they need at a price they can afford.

The truth is, if you aren't living as an ethical vegan, you are paying other human animals to imprison your fellow animals, to murder their babies and to murder them...to keep them from the 'available to all' pleasures of the Earth. Or maybe you're committing those horrors yourself, directly...I don't know.

Ben's dog is very pleased that I just gave her a new bone to chew on lol. Her name is Hershey and she misses her family VERY much. She didn't eat for the first couple of days. Now she's sleeping upstairs in Ben's room with me, eating her food, playing outside, and happy to have a bone. She doesn't like it when *I* leave to go home for a little bit though. She's taken things from Ben's room a couple of times, gotten into the trash, etc.

I joined the Palo Alto Run Club (PARC) last May, a group full of talented, hard working running and got a bunch of great runs in. Those "easy" five milers where we'd start hitting 6:25, 6:10 pace I think paid off. Do enough 6:25 miles in your regular runs, and it'll start seeming like nothing. And there's something about the shared experience of a run with others that makes all the hard work more meaningful.

A while ago a friend of mine sent me a YouTube video entitled ‘Try something new for 30 days’. I instantly fell in love with the idea and as 2012 approached I decided to make up for all the resolutions and Lent’s I’ve failed to complete by setting myself a challenge each month. I’ve already completed my first month and have been canvassing for suggestions for the rest of the year. One suggestion was to keep a blog diary every day for a month. So to get me into the swing of things I thought I’d let you in on my journey so far.

But now the shadows are all gone. Don’t think for a minute that cancer won that battle. Yesterday, Ralph’s cancer was buried in the ground for good—it’s done, it’s over, it can’t do him anymore harm. And what about Ralph? Well, you remember what Jesus said to Martha as they stood next to Lazarus’ grave? “I am the resurrection and the life. He that believes in me, though he were dead yet shall he live. He that lives and believes in me will never die.” Ralph lived and believed in the Lord, and that means that Ralph is alive and well with the Lord today. It may not look like it on the surface, and it doesn’t much feel like it right now in our hearts, but Ralph won that battle with cancer, and he’s taking his victory lap in heaven even now. You know, heaven—that place where cancer can never find its way in.

The Finish - The finish was about as cruel as the finish of Marine Corps. While there was no mountain to climb at Mile 26, there were somewhere between 5 and 8 inflatable arches...all of which I thought were the finish and kept sprinting toward. When I finally saw the Finish Line (still with about 3 arches to run under), I saw a bunch of little kids lining up in front of the barricades. There was a man in front of me who ran over to one of them, a little boy about 5 years old, grabbed his hand and ran across the Finish Line hand in hand with his son. I started tearing up and when I finally crossed, I was so emotional. I had done it. I had run Madrid. I finished my 4th marathon. I ran an unbelievable first 20 miles, well on pace for a sub-4 race. I never lost that sub-4. I never fell apart but when the realization came that my body couldn't run a sub-4 marathon after 3 weeks of eating and sleeping poorly, I didn't give up. I pushed through and I finished strong.
The job.

Whew. I went to bed at 7 last night and I'm feeling much better. I basically relied on fake enthusiasm to get through the day, and it worked. No major meltdowns (which have been almost daily for one of mine lately) and my lowest kid finally made it past 50 words a minute! (Yes, the goal for the end of the year is 90, but he was stuck in the high 20's/ early 30's for so long that this is a HUGE victory!)

Madness showcased songs from their brand new, as yet untitled, tenth studio album, in all its glory during their 'rehearsal set' this past Friday night at the House of Fun Weekender in the U.K. As with ‘The Liberty of Norton Folgate’ which the band performed live a full year before its release, Madness gave the new album tracks an early airing in their embryonic state for their most hardcore fans who attended the show. Quite a few of the songs have been played live during the band's summer tour, but it was the live debut for more than half the songs on the set list.

For so many years, I was so incredible in manifesting anything that I wanted in my world. I would write it in my journal, I would visualize it and I would believe it. Within 3 months, 6 months, or any time frame I set, it would show up. I know manifestation works because I’ve done it, tried it and succeeded at it. And now I’m taking a really deep, long breath, breathing into my heart and soul and being and just knowing that the right people, the right opportunities and clients are going to all come. I need to get out of my own way of any negative feelings and self-doubt. I mean, listen, I’m human. I know I need some of that or else I’d be on the stratosphere to the moon.
Harkaway’s writing is mindbogglingly imaginative: memorable characters, logic-defying (yet never quite illogical) plotting, and unpredictable twists. Angelmaker is much like a finely-built baroque clock: gazillions of pieces in constant movement, adding up to something gorgeous.
What I loved most about this flick was how the fighting, action, and blood were filled with so much energy and were better than half of the shit I’ve seen in the past 10 years, that I wanted more of it. Right from the beginning we get a nice little fight between The Bride and her second target on her list and it seems goofy because of all of the swooshing you hear when they move, but it’s so vicious and so brutal that it’s hard to laugh especially when these chicks are very close to just gutting the other person out. It’s a very minor scene but it’s one that starts the film off on the right foot and the action just keeps getting better by getting more vicious, more violent, and a hell of a lot more bloody. The blood is insane in this flick and it may be a bit ridiculous how Tarantino just makes every single kill have blood shoot out from these people, but it still gives this film this cool and deadly look that could only be achieved with an R-rating. Actually, it’s more of a very hard R-rating, one that only Tarantino can get because he’s the freakin’ man.
It is described as the realisation of the nature that each human being already is, as if an inverted and limited experience of life and of reality suddenly gives way to the all encompassing experience of the world as it truly is, the deeper and universally encompassing reality described by mystics, poets and saints throughout the ages from all races and all religions. And for the first time, suddenly, the words of religions and of the mystics, are comprehendible.

Well, maybe you’ll think that I’m totally crazy, but please think about it. Ever since I started to read 1/2 Prince and I saw that he sings (as you’ll find out later that he has a band), I always campared him to G-Dragon. Yeah, I know that Prince sings really different songs, but I still compared them. I always imagined how Prince is singing ‘She’s Gone’. XDDD Oh, but everything got really complicated when I saw this pic of G-Dragon… O_O

He’s a really cool guy, and I really like how he was able to give me a big-picture view of where the firm is currently, and where he’d like it to be using marketing. Also, I found out that I’ll be traveling to Washington, D.C., for a week with the firm after finals! Exciting stuff.

Starting with a wonderful loaf of going-stale bakery bread, I put together a recipe that I know will make its way into my breakfast repertoire on special occasions. When, I have a breakfast/brunch menu consisting of the usual sweet options (scones, muffins, fruit etc.), I plan on using this recipe to balance and offer guests a surprising and delightful twist on a classic.
Thus, what I have put together in the cake is what I feel in my opinion; arguably one of the best mango cake that you have ever taste. Although the recipes are not mine per say, however I always go to my trusted and tested recipes whenever I try to put a cake together. If you love mango plus it's another perfect summer treat, do read on for the recipe. I am sure your friends and family will be asking for seconds to third helpings. Enjoy!

Compared to these states, America has a special problem. These other countries are largely the result of “organic” historical processes that pushed their different populations together. America, by contrast, is much more the product of far-ranging economic processes, like Trans-Atlantic emigration from Europe and the African slave trade overlaid with modern mass immigration. Because of this different racial elements have been thrown together, and are much more disparate in character. This creates much greater ‘asymmetry’ in the differing racial characteristics, especially between Blacks and Whites.

That said, this is a big example of Not Getting It. Yes, of course women and people of color do many of the same things that white guys do, but that doesn’t mean that white guys should be considered a generic avatar through which everyone can experience the world. Is a black woman likely to have similar frustrations as a white guy when stuck in traffic? Probably. But said white guy probably isn’t also worrying whether he’s going to be assumed to be lazy and irresponsible when he’s 20 minutes late to work just because he has dark skin and boobs. We all exist in the same real-world universe, and many experiences are at least somewhat universal. But the particular filters through which those experiences come to us can be very different, especially when it comes to marginalization and privilege. Would I still watch Game of Thrones if it didn’t have a wealth of gender-noncompliant women? Probably. But I’d enjoy it a heck of a lot less because I’d be experiencing that world in a far more secondhand way than I can when I see what’s happening to Arya or Brienne as they navigate their way through a world that sees unpretty women as automatically suspect. It’s a far more personal and engaging way of experiencing a story when there’s a character with whom one has significant commonalities.

That way if he's forced to use them, the inevitable butt-kicking is a big surprise. I was bothered by a so-called karate expert once. I had finally had enough and confronted him.

The thought was sobering. As the camp grew, problems grew. It became more difficult to maintain order. There were many women alone or with children. There were a number of teenage girls quickly turning into women. Hood had noted the looks of many of the single men. It was natural but it was dangerous. Among other things, they were all sitting on a hormonal powder keg, its fuse lit by a collapse of society and its rules and norms. There were still remnants of the social mores of civilization, but many of them, like the economies of now-bankrupt nations, were teetering on the brink. One small nudge in the wrong direction … one minor crack in the code of discipline and the Freeman Militia Center could quickly turn into something ugly.

Yes, love can be wonderful and strengthening and buoying, but only if it works both ways. In my situation, it simply wasn't. He has no clue how to love. Call it a mental deficiency, a chemical imbalance, it doesn't matter. I gave my love to the wrong person. Plain and simple.

The nurse came in and said my midwife was eating down the street and wanted to know my dilation. So I got out to be checked. She said I was a 4 1/2 cm and %80 effaced. I was immediately discouraged, and now knew why women choose not to be checked. I stayed out of the tub for a while and birthed on the birth ball, tried to walk around (standing in any way seriously made contractions hurt so much worse) even laid on the bed for a little bit. I was now moaning and even crying with each contraction. My nurse was monitoring them and confirmed they were 1 min apart sometime 30 seconds apart, lasting 60-90 seconds.

This was done on the fly, made as one of 12 original pages for a documentation book of a cd swap. (It was #3.) The photograph is one of my signature old photographs; it always makes me smile. and I love how well it works in the spontaneous structure of the page.
Look at rap music - first, it was a music from the gutter, from the ghettos, angry music, detailing the daily struggle to survive, the depression, the hatred of the system that kept a young black man down, and then...

There are two reasons why these rationalizations annoy me so much. One, people always assume the best case scenario if one circumstance goes their way.
I am very fortunate to have a very loving partner. We have been together for 12 years now. She is 16 years older than me and she does just about everything – the food shopping, picking up my meds, and anything else I need done.

Besides, she also claimed that a national campaign to survey and identify poverty-ravaged populations in the country was almost complete. That presupposes that the campaign had long started. According to her, the survey will inform and direct strategies for addressing poverty within each segment of Nigeria’s population, including the elderly, women, children and persons with disabilities. A UN news release also quoted Dr. Gbeneol to have said that the one year cash transfer policy for poor families in Nigeria is one of the success stories of President Jonathan’s administration, with 113 local governments in the country as beneficiaries.

It really all began two years before we moved to Portland, about four years ago. I moved to Lake Louise, and shortly after, Ty followed. It was one of the most beuatiful places I have ever lived. But friends? They were practically non existent. How could they be? The culture there is party town. Everyone got drunk. Moste everyone did drugs and slept around. We were the token christians. I tried. believe me, I tried. But people just viewed me as naive and cute.
Schools of social work, and associations of social workers, have a vested interest in making social work sound grand and glorious. Let me put it this way: if you want to get your janitors excited about their job, and if you want to inveigle others into hiring on for the same, you don’t dwell upon the part that involves cleaning the toilet. Instead, you characterize it as facilitation of world-class organizational systems within an industry-leading milieu. If you want people to become social work students and then to graduate and become dues-paying members of your social work association, that is, you impress upon them the solemn significance of such affiliations.

In addition to the Starbucks vandalism, a group of about 150 were seen tipping garbage cans and spray-painting anarchist symbols on storefronts, sources said.
Joseph was faced with choosing a door towards his own escape or trusting God to offer a door and path beyond his own initial understanding. What questions and answers did he face from the public? What possible answers did he seek from God, and more importantly, Mary? I imagine Joseph’s initial thoughts and approach to solving this for himself would be no different than our own approach today. Perhaps, Joseph sought quiet solitude as well as experienced feelings of confusion and anger? What would be your self dialogue? Who would you talk to about such a dilemma? Eventually Joseph had his questions answered. Text from the book of Matthew brings into account Josephs dream encounter with an Angel of God explaining simply, “Do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for she has conceived a son which is from the Holy Spirit.” Could this have been the point where he really questioned his own faith?

That girl in the red dress? She played happy really well. A smile went a long way to convince people — to convince herself — that she was happy just as she was. She was uncomfortable in her own skin, and she was missing out on a lot. But, still, she never took the steps she knew she needed to lose the weight that was holding her back.

My sweet Connor James, you are one month old! This past month has been so bittersweet (mostly sweet though!). The day you were born and that sweet moment when I first saw you and you wrapped your little finger around mine when they layed you on my chest is something I will never forget! You have brought so much joy into our lives already but the sleepless nights have worn on your mommy this month.
You do know how to invest in the right place at the right time.
She cloth diapers! Her daughter is in cloth, so of course my son is in cloth with her too!
It's 4:30 in the morning, and this is what happens. I mean, I had a moderately arid day... did some Christmas arcade and sat around, mostly. But I did administer to achieve something 9-year-old me is air-conditioned appreciative of, I'm sure.

The small scapulars with which we are familiar as sacramentals owe their origin to a reduction of the large scapulars that formed part of the habit of Religious Orders and Congregations. This scapular was another of the scapulars approved during the reign of Pope Leo XIII without a confraternity. Although it was never the habit of any Order or Confraternity the Congregation of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart, founded at Antwerp in 1873 created this scapular in 1877 and were responsible for its promotion (Acta S. Sedis, XXXII, 633 sq.). It was approved at the request of the Archbishop of Marseilles, by the S. Congregation of Rites in 1900. Indulgences were granted to those who wear it habitually in 1901 and were enlarged in 1906.

And the bill came up to something close to 2k. Umm...no, I want the $875 doors please. Apparently the door prices were mis-marked, but he did go through door company after door company, and threw in promo after promo to get us down to the $875 price. We had a 10% off coupon too, and he told us to go up to the service desk to pay for it, and we could use it there. Apparently they're not allowed to double dip, but if you go up to the service desk to pay, they don't know that there's been promotions applied already to the door, so you can generally get away with using another 10% off coupon.

Some people know, others don't, but both me and my son were in mental hospitals within about the last 30 days. I had only been out for 2 days before he went in. Is it because of life issues or medication issues, or both? It feels like only I am asking that question. I don't feel good and I am not sure why. I have lots of guesses.

Emboldened by my success, I started eying the steep slope in our Batangas property. I shook my head, No it’s too crazy, that slope is too steep. But I couldn’t resist the challenge. I thought to myself, I can easily stop the bike once it reaches the garage. I’ll just put my foot down. I went up the slope and rode my bike. It was so fun until I needed to stop. I put my foot down, but the friction between my tsinelas and the ground destroyed my tsinelas. I used my other foot to stop the bike, but my other tsinelas was destroyed. I was barefoot. Without my tsinelas, I knew that if I put my foot down, the ground would cut through my skin. The bike was going faster and faster as I went down the slope. I was afraid that I would go straight to the talahib an area where snakes waited.
Well, I know the digi is called Canary Love not Bluebird Love and I had the intention of coloring the bird yellow but somehow grabbed the wrong Copic and well, now I have a Bluebird.

And there you will see your reflection.
Can you try to push to amend legislation about how many terms that a president is able to serve because I miss you! Now granted, a great deal of people still have you as a tainted president due to your marital transgressions against your wife and I am NOT condoning what you like other politicians have done. HOWEVER – This country’s statistics do not lie and you obtained financial freedom and pushed a great deal of legislation to get passed for the betterment of ALL people especially minorities – so thank you. ( The African American Community still have you pinned as the 1st Black President and you know why ) Anyway, I am positive that you have also thought about wishing that the bi -laws were different via presidency as well because watching your wife Hillary Clinton in her present position is as close as you will get to running The White House Affairs.
I have no idea why this would be worth documenting except that there are always piles of laundry in my house. Perhaps it has become an integral part of what makes a place "home". The possibility of missing the piles of unwashed clothes must be prepared for with pictures to ease the pain of separation. I should reassure her that the piles of laundry will always be there for her.

It was originally moved to replace Cumberland Gate as the new entrance to Hyde Park and to complement Decimus Burton’s arch at Hyde Park Corner. Successive roadworks in the 20th century, however, left it in its current position.

In the fourteen years I spent at three universities in the 60s/70s I acquired a store of memories that resembles Kevin MacDonald’s, if at a greater distance from the radical Jewish milieu. I too perceived the radical politics, feelings of separateness and alienation, attitude of moral and intellectual superiority, hostility to Western cultural institutions, ethnic paranoia and bunker mentality, disdain for capitalism, generic tendency to impute and then combat perceived racism and fascism, disputatiousness and intellectual sophistry, negative attitudes toward Christianity, positive attitudes toward psychoanalysis and Marxism. I too had charismatic Jewish professors with a leftist view of European and American history.
The USS booklet then goes on to continue to avoid mentioning CPI, and uses ‘official pensions’ as a euphemism, or synonym, for CPI. It sounds more unavoidable, more authoritative, perhaps. So, when the term ‘official pensions’ is used in that paragraph, reproduced here below, you can replace it with ‘CPI’:
Some people play paintball to get a paintball game. Paintball has become rapidly more aggressive since it's invention. Formerly, a game involving the paintball gun cases that will enforce safety circumstances. Particularly seeing that a player can not see past the paintball gun cases a bruise. Also, since wind resistance starts slowing the paintball gun cases an intensity and passion into practicing and training for your sport. Develop a regular schedule of practice for paintball. It is essential that all paintballers stay safe with protective paintball gear like pads, chest protectors and gloves. Each paintball game starts with a large area of paintballs. But that ton of paintballs becomes a deterrent to training as often as you want them to be, ranging from just one bunker to one more in order to accelerate the paintball gun cases at your field based on your air tank refills to anyone with an empty tank even if they're not field customers.
The preschool that Ella was in last year and this year has a tradition the week before Thanksgiving that involves the director of the school making pumpkin waffles for all the kids. I can not tell you how much Ella loves these. She talks about them for weeks. In fact, another parent who had helped with the waffle making, stopped me in the hall when I was picking Ella up and told me that Ella had seconds and wanted thirds. I thought, are you sure you got the right kid? Because getting my Ella to eat is sometimes like pulling teeth. This girl just doesn't like to sit and eat.

After the deposition of Mubarak, foreign aid, which the country greatly relied upon, was suspended in Egypt. Now, many countries are focusing on reestablishing foreign assistance in the hopes of being able to play a part in Egypt’s new political state and influence future developments in the country (Ruivaran). The United States has heavily financed Egypt’s government, including Mubarak’s oppressive regime, of which the United States overlooked the abuse of human rights. This financial aid to Egypt holds some roots in the 1950s, when many Western European countries and the United States were looking to support those “autocratic local leaders who would keep order and were most sympathetic to their Cold War policies – a opposed to those of the Soviet Union – and were most likely to maintain a friendly attitude toward U.S. and European business interests” (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 265). The new government and its new policies will complicate the U.S. involvement and interests in the region. In the future, the U.S. will have to take into account their previous act of turning a blind eye to the misrepresentation of human rights and promote a full democratic government in the country. The Muslim Brotherhood, currently in control of much of the government, is traditionally an anti-Israeli group, which brings the possibility of tensions between Israel, a U.S. ally, and Egypt, two countries which currently share a Peace Treaty since 1979. A new government led by the Brotherhood could overturn this treaty and “indefinitely affect U.S. military, trade, and diplomatic policies” (Travers). Egypt also happens to have a geographically important location in regards to the Suez Canal “which allows transport of over 2 million barrels of oil per day out of the Persian Gulf” (Travers) and therefore gives Egypt some control over oil prices and the cost of international shipping. The region itself is known for its oil exports, prices of which are mostly controlled by OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which also include countries in Latin America and the Far East (Pulsipher and Pulsipher 278). However, in the event that transportation costs for shipping oil rise, the cost of oil will also increase, impacting consumers all over the globe, especially Americans who, as a nation, consumer more oil than any other country worldwide. Though Egypt is not a major producer of oil, the country’s control of the waterway gives it the power of affecting the global economy through oil prices.
A new post on Brooklynology reminded me of a fine piece of history written by my colleague Dennis Holt. Dennis had the good fortune to stumble upon an 1885 edition of Lain's City Directory. It was sitting atop a pile of someone's garbage heap, and I can guarantee you he clicked his heels on the way home after finding it. It's true what they say about one man's trash...

There is a worthy message in The Ambassadors of Death but you have to drudge through quite a lot of padding to find it. Judging by David Whitaker's track record I can't help but think the stronger parts of this story are down to Malcolm Hulke's extensive rewrites. There are some good performances by John Abineri as General Carrington, William Dysart as Reegan and Cyril Shaps as Lennox but sadly the story is overburdened by too many unnecessary and over long action/stunt sequences. This is one of the rare times where I would have preferred the structure of the New series of Doctor Who. This would make a great story if it were condensed and speeded up a little. There are parts of The Ambassadors Of Death that are great but overall the story is hit and miss. I think it is fair to say that a large part of that was due to it's rocky conception.
Today, I am told, is Budget Day, when the preposterous George Osborne is going to tell us how our administration is going to screw us this year.

It is no surprise that most of you are modernists, not totally throwing away your traditional roots. Many of you don't choose to purchase patterns, which we suspected. You are very creative and improvisational. Then again, many of you are collectors of patterns and books; sometimes one or the other. I can say that since I started designing, I certainly purchase fewer patterns and some books. Part of it is confidence, the other is time (not enough to possibly make it). There is sometimes reward in creating "what you see is what you get". In remaking samples, I just follow the pattern and don't have to endure any brain freezes! Patterns are more affordable, especially in these economic times.

I like to think that a standard that can ring true across cultural divides is the religious standard for both male and female. The Bible speaks of the man as one with God-given authority, and the woman as a more fragile, submissive role. It gives the man authority but it doesn’t give him a license to treat the woman as property or an object to be used. Instead, he is to be a courageous leader, one who cherishes his family. The woman is to be virtuous, industrious, caring and a helper.
I woke up this morning and decided to catch-up with local and national affairs via television and the world wide web. I read many stories this morning but nothing as funny as the business with Richard Grenell. Above are three of like five or six articles I read from the Google news feed involving Richard Grenell under the tab of ‘Politics’. Anyway to sum up (feel free to check it out yourself) Richard Grenell is an adept foreign policy expert hired by the Romney campaign as their foreign policy spokesman. He’s also gay…openly gay……I know…how did “Romney” and “openly gay” get mentioned in the the same breath. Here’s how : while the Romney campaign may have *quotefingers* broke ground*endqoutefingers* in hiring a openly gay spokesman but his constituents repaved it in driving the man to resign…not that he had done very much on the official (aka TV, reports, press, etc) side anyway. Many laugh at the situation as the Romney campaign’s half-hearted ploy to win support from the LGBT community. I’m laughing at Richard Grenell…..for being a duck (think of your favorite Aflac commercial).

Marisa (her age finally matches her number of moves) is glad to start settling down again. Her schedule is mostly empty and she is enjoying that time. She is trying to find homes for all the boxes and is getting rid of a lot. “If I have not used it by now – WE DO NOT NEED IT!” She is realizing though, that without a lot going on, she does not get a lot done. But then again, tea parties, primary songs, making cookies, and saving the empire on Lego Star Wars is getting something done, right.

I said in an earlier post that Thialf is speedskating’s Mecca, and I think it’s still an appropriate description. There are other major ovals where top competitions are held with some regularity (the oval in Hamar, Norway, and those at high altitude in Calgary and Salt Lake City where world records often are set come to mind) but none that I know of is as large or as regularly packed full of fans.

The program can be taught in an hour long assembly or broken down into shorter assemblies, to meet the school’s scheduling needs. While it supports the schools efforts to stop bullying, it also focuses on bullying that happens away from the eyes of teachers and school supervisors (e.g. at an after school programs or on Saturday). By the end of the seminar, students will know how to prevent bullying, how to react when bullying does occur, as well as how to protect themselves and others from bullying behavior.

Men will always tell women that they don’t like heavy make-up. It’s just not true. What they are saying is that they hope you don’t need heavy make-up. Unless it’s garish, men generally can’t assess if a woman is wearing slap or not. There is an obvious cosmetic choice, however, that they universally like. No, love.

It doesn’t have to be this way. We can be our OWN kind of parents. We can be the kind of Moms and Dads who do their best and love their kids and vow to keep learning and growing. We can throw out the labels, the titles, the books, the methods, and the visions of what “should” be in favor of extending ourselves and others just a little bit of grace. I’m choosing to be no kind of Mom because it means I can make lots of room for everybody at my little picnic table, and if they come to my table, we can all share what we’ve got to offer.
On holiday Ms Howarth usually reverted to disposable nappies for convenience but says she tried to seek out the more environmentally-friendly ones with no gels or plastics whenever possible.
And then there are other things I should be doing – work, reading Dracula, and posting on this blog. I’m fairly sure I can put those things into my weeks at least a little bit without messing anything up too bad, but I’ve also been staying up quite late these days and adjusting to that sleep schedule when I should really try to be fixing it to something more up-in-the-mornings-and-days focused until I’m done with my work. I’m really trying to settle into being more productive, but I’m slipping up a lot, especially with holidays and sickness. My recovery from other things, however, relies a lot on productivity and satisfaction with the amount of things I get done, so I’m going to have to try a bit harder.
Some say that Heaven is just a projection of the mind’s desire to escape self-responsibility for this world through casting that self-responsibility towards something outside of self which is greater, wiser and stronger than a mere human being. This also implies great fear in the hearts of men. Has anyone ever wondered why God would need to distance Himself away from His most monumental creation called Man to disappear into the void beyond Man’s reach?

61-year-old Ampon Tangnopponkul or “Uncle SMS” who was sentenced to 20 years on lese majesté offence last November passed away this morning. He was suffering from stomach pain and sent to prison hospital last Friday, according to his lawyer, Ms. Poonsuk Poonsukcharoen. Bail request has been applied eight times and all denied. “If Ampon’s right to temporary release was upheld, he could’ve gone to see the doctor and such a tragedy might not have happened” said Poonsuk.

Halperin’s insights are manifold in this rich section of the book. Here I list those that were most salient to me as I read. First, Warner points to and Halperin fleshes out how the insistence on “Gay Pride” can actually serve to deepen the shame gay men feel about their desires and practices, by re-relegating them to the closet in contra-distinction to an out-and-proud gay-maleness. Second, Halperin turns to a right-wing French writer, Marcel Jouhandeau, who extolled the virtues of social abjection and, in particular, humiliation at being different: Jouhandeau (and later, Genet) turn abjection on its head, into a kind of sacrilization of abjection. To tease this out, thirdly, Halperin explicates two scenes from Jean Genet’s opus, in which Genet depicts social abjection, humiliation, as a process and where the abjected, humiliated subject responds by resignifying the abjection as either a source of pleasure or as the signifying source of his difference. In Halperin’s interpretation, Genet’s narrators find freedom precisely by identifying with their abjection and embracing it, refusing its deleterious effects and instead creating for themselves a re-signifying and life-affirming defiance. The more they are humiliated, the more defiant and ecstatic the narrators become. Genet’s narrative insists that loving someone who is humiliated (socially abject) requires the loving of their abjection itself.

Town planning is so important – why would you not do it? These people are not doing it because they want Covent Garden to look lovely. They are investors securing their investments for the future. They are making sure their land becomes valuable because Covent Garden is so wonderful. It’s the difference between taking a long-term view and a short-term one and it’s what our high streets need.
I make no claim to knowledge of the US system of justice, so have based what I say upon the sterling work of Craig Calcaterra, a former practising attorney, who has escaped from the law courts to be a writer for NBC about baseball (yes, that is jealousy you can hear as you read that). He has written extensively about these cases, most recently at “Hardball Talk” but he wrote at length about them before. Following Bonds’ indictment he analysed the case here.

Transformers – The effects are bound to be cool, but . . . why is this being made? Does the world really need Michael Bay’s live-action vision of a 1980’s cartoon about shape-shifting robots? Wait. I think the real question is, does the world really need Michael Bay? The last thing he directed that was even remotely watchable was The Rock, and without the kitsch factor of the animation format, the Autobot/Decepticon vendetta is going to be laughable at best. But I'm sure things will blow up real good.

I'm going to steal a joke from Kevin Bridges here. No-one ever calls people from Edinburgh Edinburgers, do they? You've got your Invernesians, Aberdonians, Dundonians, Glaswegians and cunts fae Edinburgh. It may be a joke but it's true. I can imagine that part of the reasoning for not allowing the hovercraft to run is that it'd allow easier access for dirty, six finger Fifers to cross the river and bam up the city.
Oppression is when a Christian does not yield to the Spirit of God and opens themselves up to control by evil spirits. I personally believe that once you are the child of God you can never be possessed by anyone other than God. But I also believe that God will allow us to be oppressed by evil if we are disobedient. (1 Corinthians 5:5- hand such a person over to Satan to destroy his corrupt nature so that his spiritual nature may be saved on the day of the Lord.) But I believe this oppression can be defeated by something as simple as repentance.

As it stands currently, Texas state law allows women to obtain an abortion only under specific circumstances, after a 24 hour waiting period, and only after state mandated counseling. While these state mandated stipulations are not as severe as some found in other states, they still pose a challenge to many foundations of women’s rights and women’s health. As of January 2011, a woman must receive state-directed counseling that includes information that is designed to discourage her from having an abortion. This information must be provided in person at the clinic 24 hours before a woman is allowed to obtain the procedure. The pamphlets and packets that is provided include diagrams of what the fetus looks like at its various stages and describes in detail the various organ functions developing at different states. Before the woman is provided with these detailed handouts, she is required to watch the ultra sound of the fetus as the doctor describes it in detail. The doctor is then required to look for a heartbeat in the fetus and play it for the woman, if it is found. After all of these proceedings take place, the woman must wait at least 24 hours before she can actually have the abortion preformed.

Lately, unschooling has been in the news a lot, and because of that it seems a lot of unschoolers are talking about about whether or not the exposure is a good thing! I've seen people say that because the mainstream media never properly grasps unschooling, they shouldn't bother. Or, that the extra exposure opens unschoolers up to more hassling from people who don't understand. The message behind both of these things being that unschoolers are better off staying under the radar, not letting themselves be interviewed, and just generally keeping quiet about things.

My thanks go out to the three intrepid souls who voted for this. Did you understand that you were voting to read a fictional story that I’d written centered around beer? I’ll admit, this was one of my personal favorites, though I viewed it with a bit of trepidation, since posting a fictional story centered around a beer theme would result in more work than was probably warranted given my literary acumen and the level of avid readership here at Beer Rant. What I had in mind was a serialized story centered round beer or brewing. More specifically, I’d actually begun the opening sections of a fictional story set in a post-apocalyptic United States (a’la Mad Max) wherein our hero sets out for the “forbidden zone” to find the last bastion of American brewing. (In this setting, beer has been outlawed and society’s high brow circles revel in “water sampling” parties.) Perhaps for fun, and so that the effort doesn’t go unused, I’ll post what I’ve got in the hopper so far.

She weighed in at 7 lbs, 9 oz (ha! where was my monster baby?!) and she was 21 inches long. Initially, breastfeeding went well, subsequently we've had difficulties latching, which have been resolved by pumping and supplementing with formula (making all three of us much, much happier and more relaxed). We are trying to catch up sleep - the hospital, lovely as it was, wasn't conducive to it, since I had to spend an extra 24 hours on mag in bed in L&D (which isn't really designed for that, tbh). My mom came in the day she was born, my in-laws visited soon after. We have some awesome pictures. She's absolutely delightful in every way, and we couldn't be more in love.

I had five hospice cases this weeks. That's a lot for me in one week and I am emotionally exhausted. I say a prayer before I meet with each family. I pray that I can hold it together, empathize appropriately, and assist them in one of the hardest decisions of their lives. It's a hard balance between caring and caring too much. Of course, I feel sad for these families, but I have to put up some sort of wall around my heart to keep my sanity. Ask any nurse or doctor and they would probably say the same thing. They care, but they can't care too much or they would burn out of the profession very quickly. Yes, I had five hospice cases, but to that family it was their first one. Possibly of their life.
There's not much style in Lettich's presentation of the story as well. All is pretty straight forward, as many action films are particularly from this era. Outside of a few cool camera angles, a decent foot chase that goes across the decks of docked boats, and little things like this, there's nothing really all that special about any of it. We are taken from point A to point B on a pretty straight path.

As it was, when we finally worked our way up to trotting, as I would squeeze with my legs and push her forward, she would round up and come back to me in a way, as she shoved off and went into a trot. The reins would go slack a bit and I had no contact as we moved off and sped up. That was a little unsettling for me, but as we moved a few strides along, she started to stretch out and down. Then she would stop. No reason, just stopped. It took a while and we finally went around on an egg shaped circle and made it most of the way around before she would stop again. We were making progress though so I couldn't argue or complain.

So I found this great Acer Aspire on there, that really wasn’t all that expensive. So i decided to bid on it… First mistake, because it took me bout 7 bids to get the other bidder off my back. The bidding fight stopped at the price of about 400 USD… I was happy, cuz if I waited for another 23 hours, that laptop was mine. So I went to bed… When i woke up, I recieved an email saying my bid was no longer the highest… Someone had bid EXACTLY 2 USD more than me… When I tried to bid over him, Ebay told me that the seller did not allow anymore bids…
(Where's the "cure" you ask? If that's the main reason you haven't been making jerky, well, come on down! I hate sodium nitrite. Imagine my surprise when at my Master Food Preserver Class, Barbara Ingham, Wisconsin's Extension food scientist and our teacher, said I didn't have to use it! There was a catch. Without cure in it, you will store it in the refrigerator. If you are going on a camping trip, etc., it will keep for 2 weeks out of the refrigerator, but not indefinitely. This more than covers me for a day long shopping trip, or Rick for a day of pheasant hunting.)

For the second time now, I sewed an entire garment "in the flat." Does anyone else do this? What the heck do I mean? Well, the instructions for the pattern I used, Butterick 5976, would have you sew the side, back and shoulder seams, then attach the collar and facing, insert the zipper next, and then ease in the sleeves and hem them (those tiny little sleeves!) before hemming the dress bottom.

UBS, Citigroup, ABN Amro, Barclays, Bank of New York Mellon, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Lloyds, State Street, Wells Fargo, and finally Bank of America are all talking about massive lay offs. Bank of America may actually cut 10,000 jobs which would mean a 3.5% reduction of their work force. When the biggest financial institutions are opting to run skeleton crews we are in serious trouble. Most jobs in America are service jobs or financial jobs. I say we need a radical reduction in CEO compensation. If they really believe in their company they can take one for the team, and realize that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

When I created this blog six years ago, I remember sitting with a blank mind in front of a blank screen. What do I write? What do I title my blog? How do I sum up what I have yet to write? Somehow, the phrase, “somewhere in-between” emerged from my hovering fingertips. Where it came from I still do not know. At the time, I had a sense that I was living a nomadic lifestyle, wandering without a map. I felt like I was somewhere in-between homes, and somewhere in-between a child and a parent.
1) The Palestinians can’t disguise their crimes as military actions. The Israelis can. We can’t say “the Israelis don’t kill civilians;” at most, we can say that the extent of IDF operations makes it impossible to ascertain if the civilians that they kill are intended murders or not. The recent case of an old man killed in his sleep by IDF forces provides an excellent example of a totally unnecessary and highly suspicious death in which the soldier who pulled the trigger is acquitted based on his own testimony.

There lies a tension here between Kochan’s perceived true self, and his actual true self, forming confusion with masks at the heart of it all. With a mask hiding his true self, and a mask expressing his true self, is it possible to clearly define which mask does the hiding, and which allows for expression? And if both his true self and his false self take the form of a mask, is either of them really his “true self?” The title, Confessions of a Mask, suggests nothing exists beneath the mask; the confessions are coming from the mask, not from the person beneath the mask. Can he be his “true self” without a mask? And going along with that question, does he despise the mask? Or does he desire it?

So the next few years of Albert Pujols will give the Angels more value than any other player in the league possibly could. Unfortunately, the contract is not for five or six years, it is for 10 years and $254 million.
A person in a higher state of consciousness is expected to know everything. But while the mind and the consciousness possess the ability to know everything, do they really need to know everything? “All knowing” simply means being conscious of the essence of all you know. In this state, both knowledge and ignorance co-exist and complement each other. For instance, while playing a game, it is not knowing the result beforehand that makes the game sincere and fun. If one knew the result even while playing, the players (and the game) would lose their intensity.

So, I will leave you all to your chilblained fingers tapping on warm computer keys, and I will brave the elements. But don’t expect me to tell you what I learn. My winter is not your winter. We each have to describe the winter that only we can experience, otherwise there is no reason to describe it at all.

Meanwhile, I have been assured the people who will be hauling my things to yet another location will be here on the 1st. So, I started to arrange things, throw things away, perform the beginnings of what has now become an art form for me. But, then I get the call. It turns out the individual who is moving my things has been suddenly informed he needs to go out of town for two weeks and is now trying to fit me in before he leaves. So, he`s going to squeeze me in on the 27th. A couple of hours later I am told “let`s make it the 28th.“ As it now stands, I am moving on the 26th, which means in two days. But, we haven`t gotten to the time yet and that just might be my final hour.

I'm not going to go into details, because obviously, sex is a sacred commitment between two married people, but I will say that Day Four was hard, and I don't mean that in the Hard-Hard way, if you know what I mean. I mean that well, you know, I didn't want to wait till it was too late because I am tired, he is tired, so it's one of those sneak-away-when-he-gets-home things. Day Four was challenging hard.

I left New York in June, seeking purpose, and more creative opportunities, to find a real relationship with a man, to drive my car and get my stuff out of storage. I like to imagine I am better now. I no longer dwell on the events of the day, try not to conjure up the pictures etched on the back of my closed eyelids, for when I do, I remember that I have only a fragile grasp on control, and even that is held together by the tenuous threads of my logical mind. My irrational mind still wants to let go and fall. I still want to peel my grasping fingers loose and let my soul take flight. I still want to scream, I want to hit and hurt. I want to scratch my fingers down something soft and yielding, I want to bite down HARD and feel the blood spurt in my throat as something gives in my teeth. I have this caged animal inside of me that is clawing to escape and it is a struggle to keep it quiet. Ice, I tell myself. I am ice, Ice is hard and cold. Ice feels no pain, nor sorrow or anger or fear. Ice needs no fire to survive, and indeed, maybe my internal fire needs to be doused so I will feel less sad, less anger, fear no more, and the bruises of loneliness will heal.
2) My “spot.” I’ve been going to the same Barnes & Noble café for the last five years. My novel was born there and so was this blog, along with countless other writing projects. In particular, I have a favorite table that lets me observe the door, the café, and the book floor. It’s a great spot for people watching when I need a character in a pinch. I’ve made some great friends among the employees and the regulars, which makes this place a true second home. Not to mention, they make great coffee!
So why am I posting all of these touchy-feely ramblings today? I feel like I need to give back. If I can give at least one person the hope and encouragement that they, too, can run, bike, swim, or ___________(insert challenge here), then I have done my job.
6. Jabberjaw: (First aired 1976, ran until 1978) As part of the overall shark mania of the 1970s and shortly after the then-recent film Jaws, Hanna-Barbara Inc. released Jabberjaw--a Saturday morning animated series about a 15-foot talking great white shark. Jabberjaw was the drummer for a rock group made up of four teenagers who all lived in an underwater civilization in the year 2076. As Jabberjaw and his rock band buddies traveled to different underwater cities, they would encounter and attempt to conquer diabolic villains with plans to take over the undersea world. The format and writing for Jabberjaw was similar to that for Scooby-Doo and Josie and Pussycats, but for a time when people were scared out their minds of sharks, you've got to admit it was pretty cool to create one that was heroic and loveable.

I’m fairly candid on here even when I probably shouldn’t be. I’m usually okay with that until I have to actually face the people who read what I write and the potentially judgement therein. I debated posting this, but fatigue has made me reckless. I guess I’ll do damage control as necessary. *shrug*
This interchange between the stable type and our fluid history is key. Our personality profile defines a mode of life in the face of changing events, and our development as a person has everything to do with how we do or do not manage to adapt those patterns to those events. Since those events manifest most clearly in our shadow function, we can talk about the way those functions both have a history and remain stable.

So, finally the unanswered question of succession to Mubarak. Although he hadn't officially announced yet, Hosni's son Gamal seemed a likely candidate to take over the reigns. Posters advocating a Gamal Mubarak presidency were already plastered all over downtown Alexandria. So at least they could keep it all in the family, you know, like the best dictators do.
You and your administration have achieved what we thought was impossible in such a short time: you have actually increased misery and sadness inside the state, even as you’ve turned Bengal into the laughing stock of the rest of India. If, under the Left Front, the rest of India used to pity us and snigger at us, now the country is just laughing at us, belly-laughter mixed with open contempt.
One peanut who ‘didn’t thunk it’ was Mark Marangoni, an 18 year old from Melbourne’s, outer west who hosted a quiet gathering for about 300 knuckle-draggers who all became severely offended when residents called police. A barrage of rocks, bricks and bottles were hurled at police and, when the dust settled and four cave-dwellers were arrested, a few interesting facts emerged.
It is my take — for whatever that’s worth — that the kind of ads being run by the Romney Campaign and by the PACs supporting his candidacy are effective when viewed by 65-70% of likely voters. Here’s just one more.

I received an invite to an adoption support group at a local church. The event was for families who've adopted, foster to adopt parents, or those in the process of adoption. Another teacher and I decided we would go last week. Although yesterday, I wanted to change my mind. I didn't want to go. But then, sitting in church today, I felt that God was calling me to attend. He wanted me there. So, we went. The gathering was an Easter Egg hunt, combined with an animal entertainer, and a flag raising in front of the church, to honor the country where their most recent adoption came from. My teacher friend and I saw some parents we knew and immediately were introduced to some new faces. We watched in awe the many beautiful faces of children from around the world. We had the opportunity to listen to testimonies of so many successful and unsuccessful adoptions, foster situations. The families were very supportive and open about their journeys. One thing was clear, it was all worth it. They'd do it all over again. I appreciated their honesty and letting us know, adoption and waiting is not an easy thing. God's message was clear though. He's with us, he has been all along. It reminded me of the Footprints story. http://llerrah.com/footprints.htm I believe God's purpose for me being there was another way of saying, "Hang in there, you will be blessed beyond imagination, if you continue to believe." So we are praying for the many other couples and families out there who are continuing to wait and having a difficult time. God be with you.
I am way more passionate about football this year than in the past- like feeling depressed the next day after the game when we don't win.

On New Year's Day, I opened the drawer of my bed stand. There was my journal, and Annie's, but Henry's was absent. I gave my room a cursory rummage to no avail. My husband consoled me, saying it's bound to show up somewhere. Still, days later, I have not found it. It's absence is nagging at me. Multiple times a day I open my bed stand drawers, hopeful that by some miracle the journal will be there, found. I've entertained the idea of searching for it in the strangest places - like the big blue garbage cans in the garage - uncertain if these impressions are the product of inspiration or complete lunacy.
The calendar says it is Fall which brings with it cooler, crisper weather. The leaves change colors and we put away the short sleeves and bring out the sweaters...in theory. Unfortunately, Houston is still in the stranglehold of Summer and we will be wearing tank tops and flip flops for the foreseeable future. Regardless of the temperatures, Fall is a time of changes and we in the Banker house are not impervious.
Today, in Vietnamese class, we started doing some stuff with food. We each had a menu and pretended to be ordering food and drinks from imaginary waitresses. It was then that I realised for the past two weeks when I’ve been trying to order “sinh tố thơm” I’ve been pronouncing it “sinh tố tôm.” That simple pronunciation difference, which I still can’t hear, is the difference between ordering a pineapple smoothie to ordering a shrimp smoothie, literally. I’m glad that no one has made me a shrimp smoothie. That would have been nasty.

… Eyes following the spot light at first saw nothing, nothing but a bar hanging, swaying slightly as if it were an abondandond swing blowing in the wind. As th confused wispers broke the silence out of nowhere a shimmering pink flash jolted to the bar. Swinging,flipping, turning, posing; relfecing the light with an otherworldly glow, the figure had transfixed the onlookers. The eyes traced the sparkle through the air, following he path, admiring her presision. She did not falter or fail; she was an eagle at prey, diving through the air and clasping her tallons around the bar. Only to swing back into effortless grace of a dove freed from containment. Entranced by the beauty above their heads and petrified with fear that a single sound might dare shatter whatever pneonome that kept the sparkle afloat, no one dared to speak . Many wouldn’t be able find the right words to do justice, had they tried. She floated on a cirlclar hoop, slowly spun, allowing the on lookers a long look upon her perfectly slender yet daringly curvious body, before blowing a single kiss and diving into the darkness below , taking the breath of the onlookers with her …
I took them home and started the process of breaking them in to get them ready for Boston. I went on some short runs and eventually used them for my Sunday long runs.

I was probably nine or ten when I got the idea that beards developed gradually out of uncut sideburns and consequently refused to let my sideburns be trimmed for several consecutive haircuts. The barber teased me about Elvis. Other people wondered if I was trying to look like Spock. In different clothing and with a little curl, I would have looked more like a young Hasid. At some point, I figured out that no new hairs were about to start growing under my sideburns and stopped.

There is some sort of sorcery involved in flan. The caramelized sugar that you line the moulds with, and that immediately turns solid, somehow turns into liquid caramel gold when you serve the flan. I don't know why - I think you have to have an in with the Mexican gods to get the real answers.

"Memory is the greatest curse ever inflicted on mankind," drama critic Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten) says at one point in the film and this line in many ways reflects what made this movie such a breakthrough. Citizen Kane explores a sort of existential mystery, attempting to encapsulate one man's life by deciphering the meaning of his dying word. Welles proved a wonder in his film debut, playing the title character, producing, directing and co-writing the movie — all at the tender age of 25.
Items from the Lefferts collection span centuries of history, from when the Lefferts family first settled in Flatbush in 1660. The family came to own large tracts of property, not only in Brooklyn, but in Queens County, Staten Island and New Jersey as well.
Would I want everything in my house to operate in the most complicated possible manner? Do I want to live in a world where molehills are intentionally turned into mountains? Oh heavens no. Can you imagine trying to navigate your daily obligations while at the mercy of a crank and fifty gears for each task? Perish the thought! We don't have time for everything we do to be about the journey, rather than the destination. Everything cannot, and should not, be complicated like this wonderful winecork puller-outer.
Do not live beyond your means. This takes time and a change in attitude to accomplish. The rise of consumer credit in the past few years has made it far too easy to buy items without being able to pay, and the bills are coming due.

Along the way, I have found these two books (Yoga for Women by Karin Bjorkegren and Yoga for Your Life by Margaret and Martin Pierce) to be useful for well executed postures/poses, detailed explanations and insightful tips on breath, movement and additional wholesome health thoughts. Let’s face it, we cannot always sneak away to practice in a studio, but we can find at least 30 minutes at home to move, breath, stretch and be. We owe it to ourselves to live fully. And even if you are a runner, a swimmer, or a CrossFit junkie, yoga might be the calming oasis or peaceful centering addition to your exercise regime (and bonus points, practicing yoga offers an amazing workout).
What difference does the weather make you ask? Well, for me, it means my children spend all day hosing each other off to keep cool and I'm constantly picking up wet, dirty, molding clothes out of the back yard.

The body was quite heavy and left you in no doubt that you were drinking a beer with a certain gravitas. There was an initial blast of moderate ginger bitterness on the tongue which followed through in the aftertaste. However, the aggressive expected ginger assault never materialised.

Good morning! I was so busy posting my December Memories album last month that I didn't get a chance to share a couple more projects for Emma's Paperie. All of the designers created a project using amazing transparencies and rub-ons by Hambly Studios. And this "Very Merry" layout is what I came up with for my project. I created the color scheme based on the colors in the girls' Christmas dresses. And I actually got a little technique happy and made "snow globes" with the transparencies. For a complete supply list, please visit the Emma's Paperie blog here.

Clocks always grab my attention, and these clock faces, shared by eleven-o-one were no exception. What's so terrific about these faces though, is that they were crafted with old cd's and some clock face images. They were made for a women's retreat whose theme was, "For Such a Time as This". Sounds like a wonderful retreat, that was fabulously decorated.

In the few years I have lived on this planet; in what the pious claim: my physical form, for the greater part of my being is of a metaphysical nature, I have come to question this idea of culture we have grown within our midst.

The Lord God says to you, My flock: I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and male goats. Isn’t it enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Or isn’t it enough that you drink the clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? Yet My flock has to feed on what your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied. (Ezekiel 34:17-19)

Being a mother can be so challenging at times. My 11 year old daughter and 12 year old son have there own personal war going on, that no one else seems to get. It starts in the morning before school, after school and continues on until someone or both ends up going to bed early. They have a very difficult time being in the same room with one another without picking at one another, instigating arguments, or doing something intentionally to make the other one angry.
My wife and I went to have an ultrasound yesterday and found out that we are expecting triplets. We already have a 2 year old daughter and the thought of adding 3 more and doubling our family was a bit overwhelming. Not to mention the fact that the doctor doing the ultrasound was incredibly negative. He put on the doomsday cap and started telling us everything that could go wrong and that we should consider a selective reduction around week 10-12 mark.
Can't really do a certified review of this one. It did taste fantastic, but it wasn't exactly carbonated yet. Kinda weird since it's been bottled almost a week longer then my lager. I poured a 22 oz bomber and split that for both Kevin and I. You could see the start of carbonation, but it clearly needs to sit another week. Actually, after tasting it, we feel that it tasted pretty green and that it could use about a month to sit and mellow. It was very complex. The great thing about it is, the woodiness of the maple sap really came through. It almost tasted like it had been aged in oak barrels to me. Also very present was the aroma of coffee. I'll update a better review once it's sat for another month and has had time to fully carbonate and to mellow a bit.

The Brother machine is $250 while the Janome is $450. The Brother machine has 90 built in stitches, including monograms, while the Janome only has 50. I can't say I will definitely use all the built in stitches but the capability to monogram could be pretty awesome. However, the Janome is available from the trusted local repair shop I took my baby to, while the Brother would have to be order online from someone. I did briefly play around with the Janome at the repair shop and though it was pretty standard machine that will work wonderfully but at almost twice the cost of the Brother it is hard justify. Although my Janome serger is a trooper. I have had it for 6-7 years and have (wince) never had it serviced or oiled and it still runs wonderfully, just a little nosier. Does anyone have experience with either of these machines and/or brands that they can help me decide?

I place everything dirty in the wet bag, pull the draw string tight, place it in the diaper bag and it works really well for us. We don't have issues with bad smells and I prefer to use cloth on the go even though it means more to carry around, because with cloth, we don't have messy blowouts that end up on his clothes.

By the way, the tugboat shown most completely in the 4th foto is the 1943 46.5′ Linda G. I don’t know where she was built. Pegasus is 96′ and 1907-built in Baltimore. The goslings, hatch of 2012, were about 4″ long.
This kept me off the mat for a class or two. My doctor didn’t find anything on the x-rays and put me on crutches. Meanwhile, I sat on the sidelines during class itching to be back on the mat. I couldn’t take it and started thinking of ways to practice. There are techniques in seated positions that we learned. If we could do some, why couldn’t I do all of the techniques we learned in seated positions? I had to adapt to a physical limitation. I got back on the mat and fellow aikidoka willing to work with my own limitations happily partnered with me and our sensei helped me make adjustments as needed.

In many ways, the Ozarks world of Winter’s Bone harbors a way of life that seems to have changed little since the Great Depression. Oh sure, the cars and clothes are newer, and the local underground industry has switched from moonshine to crystal meth. But the mentality feels mostly the same- fierce territoriality, a strained-at-best relationship to the Law, and tenuous blood ties that only hold up to the point where they stop being useful. It’s a pocket of America that feels like a distant planet compared to the contemporary suburban sprawl, to say nothing of the big city, and it’s the kind of place where those who hail from elsewhere thank the heavens that they weren’t born, and where those who were born there rarely manage to escape.

After my beautiful child was born, Fabio did not cope at all. I suppose that once he saw this baby shit got real. He came to the conclusion that he couldn’t be the father and off we went on the rigmarole of DNA tests so my son could have his Father’s name on his birth certificate. It was a little stressful and my respect for him waned big time but hey – what can you do? You can’t force someone to be a man and face up to their responsibilities. They can only do it when they are ready.
Had a fabulous day yesterday – a nice blend of work and fun. I love it when I’m exhausted at the end of the day and maaaan, did I pass out. Got some work for Lucy done and went for a long drive up A1A. Delray Beach is having the Delray Affair (big arts and crafts and food show), which means everyone and their brother is downtown. Which means I will be nowhere near downtown. I went once. That was enough for the next 10 years.

It was on this web site that I came across marketing professor Rajendra Sisodia (who has his MBA in Marketing from the Bajaj Institute of Management in Mumbai, India and a PhD in Marketing from Columbia University), who believes that traditional marketing is going away.

A recent study by California’s Research and Policy Center concluded that even residential solar in California could reach grid parity by 2015. This is because the falling price of solar panels and the increasing number of installers means that competition has driven down the cost per watt, to an estimated $5.25 per watt installed by 2015.

FG: Again, I think you need to see the pictures of Rodes online then see the one of me as Rodes. Looking just like your real life character, I have to admit, made it a little easier, but on the other hand, it provided a lot of pressure because after visiting his burial site in Lynchburg, Virginia, I felt like I had a lot to be accountable for—to try to deliver a resemblance of this man, not only in looks, but character, integrity, the whole ball of wax. I read as much as I could. I visited the actual battle grounds, walked the grounds of VMI, and I even talked to him, or tried to, a few times asking for his help. I know that sounds strange but I did! Every time I put on the uniform I would say, “Ok Robert Rodes, let’s do this together”.

When we become a resource for accurate information our children are able to turn to us for cues as to what might be an appropriate behavior in a new situation. When we are involved in our children's lives we have a better idea of what situations are appropriate for our children and how we can support them so they can enjoy a new experience. When we remain connected with our children in any situation we are aware of what is going on with and around our children which enables us to offer positive support or information as it is needed. When we make our relationship with our children the most important priority in our life we get to have more fun as we explore the world together.

Latinos United for Change (Latinos Unidos para Cambio) is a grassroots community organization in the Illinois rural heartland seeking to bring about progressive, people centered change. The mission of the organization is to empower Latinos and new immigrants to become full partners in the local, state and national dialogue on justice issues that affect their future. Resulting from a process of issue identification, direct action and reflection the current organizing issues include: comprehensive immigration reform, passage of a Illinois “Dream Act”, protecting undocumented worker rights, and stopping the pipeline from expulsion to prison for school age Latinos.
I got so much shit about being friends with him from my mom and other people that I stopped talking to him. He tried to talk to me many times but I had decided that I cared what other people thought about my choices. By the time I realized shutting him out was wrong, he was done talking to me. He got deep into heavy drugs. A few months later he tried to get in contact with me and I ignored him. Three days later he died. I have blamed myself ever since. No one ever said it was my fault, of course. They tell me that he was crazy about me and that I was good for him. His mother loves me and always buys me presents while I am always feeling like I should tell her how sorry I am.

After discovering "no one" at any of my doors and turning on porch lights and flood lights......I did become a bit concerned. I figured it was a prank, but there is always a little doubt in your mind that maybe something more sinister is at work. I called my grandson. I asked him if he had been here, by any chance....just clowning around. He said no, why? I told him. He became concerned. Within minutes he and his friends were here checking out my yard and then they retreated to an area where they could watch and sat there for about a half hour, just watching. Nothing was amiss and they didn't even see any gangs of kids. My grandson is grown and his friends are BIG. I was glad they had my back.

Within a few moments, the technician had declared the pregnancy to be early enough to undergo a medical abortion. She handed Tori a towel to wipe the gel off her stomach. She was led to the large armchair where she was told she would be injected with the chemical that would stop the pregnancy from growing. Nadine showed her the three tablets she had to take in three days in order to expel the tissue. She wiped her bicep with some alcohol and then stuck her syringe in the vial with the Methotrexate, lifted it up and drew out the contents.

Moderation is something humans don’t do well without divine intervention. Over-indulgence is something we more easily gravitate towards. Fortunately there is hope for us. I believe capitalism can be redeemed by those with a Biblical worldview and a willingness to do business God’s way.
As for the cast, Jennifer Lawrence owns Katniss. She’s prickly, devoted to her family, and hellbent on survival. She gives Katniss a rich emotional life without saying a single word. Her rapport and chemistry with Willow Shields, who plays a delicate, startled Prim, and Amandla Stenberg, who plays a quiet, trusting Rue, are absolutely brilliant. Josh Hutcherson’s Peeta is seemingly earnest and adaptable, while Liam Hemsworth’s briefly seen Gale is dependable and good-natured. (Two things—one, holy crow, the Hemsworth men are ridiculously attractive, and two, my audience cracked up pretty much every time we cut from the Games to Gale watching at home.) The Capitol adults are fascinating, especially Seneca Crane. The film spends some time on the actual production of the Games, as overseen by Seneca, and to see him take pride in well-crafted murder games is a special kind of horror. I should also mention Lenny Kravitz as a low-key Cinna, who, just as in the book, remains the one man who connects the deepest with Katniss, and Donald Sutherland as a calm President Snow. As we barely see in the novel, I can’t compare. And last, but certainly not least, is Stanley Tucci’s Caesar Flickerman. To quote Cleolinda Jones (…yeah, my review is essentially a “ditto” of hers), “[he] manages just the right combination of complicit, outrageous, compassionate, fake and sincere.” It’s truly an incredible amount of talent and hard work on display here, which, to be totally honest, I never expected out of an adaptation of this novel. Well done, everyone, well done.
I’m not one for dwelling on the past. I’m not one for regret. But I do believe in learning from the past, reflecting on our experience, and I understand how unresolved issues from the past can exert a powerful influence on us all in the present. Feelings of hurt and loss, of abandonment or rejection can create deep emotional and behavioural patterns based on harmful beliefs around low self-worth that I often see manifesting in anger and depression. They can also give rise to forms of self-abuse and addiction – consuming excessive amounts of food or alcohol and other drugs to change the way we feel, or to stop feeling altogether.

I've really come to appreciate Monday in the last two weeks. I usually work on Tuesday and Wednesday, have pre-school co-op on Thursday and then the weekend starts! Sunday has become a "work day"...so by Monday I'm thrilled to relax, clean-up, spend time with the kids and re-charge for the week ahead.

Then again, I think we got that from all the fighting so I’m not sure we needed the narration. What we really didn’t need is the sudden starting and stopping of laughter–we get it, he’s crazy. That bit really broke the movie for me. It was the first crack that made sure nothing else in the movie would be tense because I didn’t care about this guy anymore. I just wanted him to stop.

Fast forward to December 28, 2011 and I've been reading up on all of the recent ISKCON ( International Society for Krishna Consciousness) related news. Two or three times a year I'll check out the numerous web / blog sites and try and get a feel for the current issues that they are dealing with.The whole modern Hare Krishna movement was begun single handily by a 69 year old Indian reunciate preacher In a small Second Ave. N.Y.C. storefront in 1966. It slowly splintered apart almost from the day the founder of ISKCON, A.C.Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, died in November of 1977. Before passing away he named eleven senior devotees to be in charge, but all too quickly there were various power struggles and conflicts that still haven't been totally resolved as of today. The late 1970's, and into the 1980's sadly had numerous cases of young children being sexually molested in the movement's school system, and many of the original eleven handpicked disciples that formed the Governing Body Commission (GBC) had either quit (" fell down" ), died, or been forced to resign over various sex, drugs, and money issues. ISKCON today is very vibrant in its native India, and has had varying degrees of success in finding new devotees in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. The U.S. temples have gradually changed from a proselytizing emphasis based on distributing Prabhupad's books, to one of retrenchment that now largely caters to the local Indian communities that are their major support group. The counter - culture in 1966 was ready to throw off all of the "Establishments" views including having a career focused life, with traditional Christian values and rituals. More than a few people decided to tune in, turn on, and drop out. But it wasn't all drugs that they were turning on to.

So, I wanted to create an extra special, vintage and over the top girlie card to send off to her to help express my sincere gratitude for her generosity and kindness! Words don't seem to be 'enough' to convey how much this simple gesture touched my heart! I guess I'm a bit emotional these days with the impending surgery so close. I don't know why ... I seem to cry at the drop of a hat these days ... I know the surgery is 'best', but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the emotional side of everything. I'm 47 ... our family is more than complete and we don't want any additional children ... my hubby assures me that he'll still look at me the same way ... my emotions are raw and really close to the surface :(
This film left many questions unanswered about what had happened to cause a loving father in a 'perfect' family to smash the wife he had always adored over the head with the blunt end of an axe. Most unfortunately the eldest son, Henry, who was 16 at the time, witnessed the immediate aftermath of this atrocious act and has been trying to live with the impact of it ever since, including protecting his little brother who was then just ten.

Then, clutching a pint glass containing a local cider brew, we sidled into the main theatre for one of the main highlights of the Festival... Onto the stage came not only our poet laureate, clad in a flowing grey top, but a musician by the name of John Sampson who proceeded to floor us with his playing of penny whistles, recorders of all sorts, crump horns and goat horns, at one point donning a Mozart wig. Oh he was so clever. Acted with his eyes and had everyone in stitches. Or he had us on the verge of tears... as he accompanied CAD in her reading of some of her poems. She in turn accompanied us on a journey through the gamut of emotion – we laughed at her observations, and we nodded in understanding and in awe, and we cried. At least I did – when she finished with a poem about her mother. But they were good tears!
These sisters didn’t hide their confusion and hurt and Jesus didn’t rebuke them for confronting Him. In this case, Jesus quickly answered their questions.

Schenck’s been dead now for almost a century. What happened to him was a grave miscarriage of justice, and I’m appalled that he hasn't been honored as a folk hero, a poster boy for the First Amendment. It doesn’t really matter whether fighting WWI was the right thing to do or not. He wasn’t distributing false information. He wasn’t giving away national secrets. He was expressing an opinion, and it’s astounding that a nation that prides itself on being the “land of the free” locked him up for doing that.

The initial ache and pain has seemed to dull slightly. Some days it is a very deafening pain, while others it's quite transparent. I am beginning to get a grasp on what 'living' without her really is. Now we have moved past the 'coping' and moved into the surviving. We have embarked upon a new journey down a different path. I always take a rest along the way, close my eyes and try to imagine how differently our journey would have been. I miss her terribly and that is something that has never dulled. That, I'm sure, it never will.

Back home, it's been a mad mixture of trying to open up a new shop with a thousand African setbacks, running the chaotic current shop with same setbacks, lack of internet at home, and too much tennis and now soccer to watch on TV. Due to all of the above, I have really cut back on personal time online. I also made a decision to deactivate my Facebook account about 3 months ago, which has been a rather strange experience, having been on it since 2007.

I have an interesting, and often annoying, work schedule. I work at least one weekend day each week and the day alternates every month. So in March, for example, I work each Sunday, which leaves me all the Saturdays to show my horse.

A lot of the shows I want to go to are on days I have to work and only being able to show every other month is a bummer...
There is no way to describe her other than that she was very "Boulder." Anyone who lives in the Pacific Northwest probably knows what I'm talking about here. She was... I don't know... new-agy. Nothing she said, in particular, but I got the yoga-Whole-Foods-vegan-align-your-chakras vibe almost immediately (and yes, I realize the irony of that statement).
Wednesday, 5/23: Cheesesteak “hash” and vegetables
This month we did battle with comic book adaptations and we won. Especially me! Blamo! Pow! I did my requisite eight reviews, and I passed a difficult professional certification (that included math) all in one month. Now that’s superheroic. To me.
I've had this blog for a couple of years I think, but haven't been actively posting until about the last year. It has been a lot of fun for me and serves as something of a journal. I've really enjoyed it! Now I am coming up on my 100th post which seems like a good time to do my FIRST giveaway! I don't have anything purchased yet, but hope to have something to show you by the end of the weekend. You can count on it being fabric-y! Just leave me a comment on this post and your name will be thrown in the drawing! Oh, how fun!! I'm really excited about this! Hope you spread the word too!

The Good: This fifth grade battle of the sexes plays out in October 1962, against the backdrop of Cuban Missile Crisis. Wittlinger lets the reader connect their own dots about the motivations and fears of the various kids and parents. For example, Patsy. Patsy adores her father, but he prefers spending quality time with his son, Patsy's younger brother. Patsy loves her father, is interested in what he is interested he, but he cannot see how a girl would be interested in mechanics and airplanes. Patsy never says that the reason she is driven to best the boys in the challenge is to prove something to herself and her father. Juliet never connects those dots, either. Instead, Wittlinger respects the reader, letting them make this connection.
This is such a great product. I've been using this nearly every time I put on make-up, either in its lonesome, or as a base under a different blush/bronzer. I have a small collection of creme blushes from MAC, but I rarely used them because, although I loved the colours, I just did not like the formula. The formula to this particular creme blush from MAC is so smooth and light weight (gel-like), imparts lots of pigmentation that is buildable and doubles as a lip product!
Today's event featured Tomahawk Tassels, a beautiful woman in tongue-in-cheek Native American garb. (She did a whole schpiel before she modeled about her choice of costume...she's actually quite savvy and smart--pointed out the irony of it all, etc.)
Kave fills each truffle with either dense Callebaut ganache or handmade perzipan, a lighter, fluffier version of marzipan (the ganache centers rule). Flavors are both straightforward and unusual, with fruits dominating: pomegranate, raspberry, mango and banana truffles fill the display case. But there are options for those whose palates favor spicy, savory or nutty. The popular Frida truffle, for instance, combines Mexican cinnamon, espresso and Kahlua, and the Zydeco is a medley of chili jams and confits, infused tequila and sea salt. Each truffle is then delicately topped with a sliver of whatever lies inside.

The problem with the analogy… which actually isn’t that bad of an analogy, it is just being mis-used… is that the ratio of sales for, and importance of, traditional physical retailers today isn’t anything like the complete lack of significance that horse travel represents today.

In College I was 30lbs heavier than what I weigh now- sad but when I delivered Sterling I was pretty darn close to what I weighed in College! I was a girl that liked to booze and eat way too much! At Chick Fila in college I would order a sandwich and nuggets as my meal- way too much food. Then I would drink copious amounts of booze at fraternity parties and I ballooned quickly! Funny thing is I never thought I was overweight til after college. I slowly lost the weight post college and promised myself I will never weigh that again. Now I weigh myself almost everyday. I don't believe in not using a scale and "feeling my body". I need to see numbers and I find by checking frequently my weight never gets out of control. I have a target weight I never want to get above so if I am higher one day I just cut back and chug lots of water and exercise to get back on track.

As we walked, the wind picked up and I put my hood on. It reminded me that Trayvon Martin was also wearing a hoodie when he was murdered last week. I tried to imagine what was running through his head as he walked to the store for his Skittles and iced tea. Was he thinking about homework, what subjects he liked to learn and what subjects bored him to tears? Was he thinking about or what he was going to have for dinner, hoping that his mother would make him his favorite meal? Was he thinking of his girlfriend, excited and uncertain like every other teenager in love?

To my shock and horror, Annika suddenly knocked on Kuya’s door, then she ran away, leaving me behind. Kuya opened the door, and he saw me standing there. Bakit ka kumakatok? he said, irritated. I was like, hindi ako yon, si Annika! Si Annika! Unconvinced, he closed the door. He became more and more unconvinced as this thing kept happening again and again— Annika knocking on the door, Annika running away, and Kuya finding me outside his door with the same I-didn’t-do-it defense.

Even if you take good care of your health and have a relatively safe job, depending on your recreational activities, the insurance company may or may not agree to insure you. For example, skiing, surfing, skydiving, scuba diving, base-jumping, snowboarding and rock climbing are just a handful of the activities that an insurance company may frown upon.

The first week was fantastic. I prepared Cajun fish, corned beef and cabbage with Irish soda bread (for my Irish descended friends along with my family), fish and chips, London broil, butter chicken, chicken parmesan, tuna casserole, hamburgers, and my mother's fried chicken (which is unbelievable). I may have missed a couple, but you get the idea.
Where is the “religion of peace”? Saudi Arabia scrambled luxury jets to Guantanamo Bay prison earlier this year to bring 9/11 Islamo terrorists “home” to heroes welcomes and “rehabilitation” in luxury resorts, goodness knows the Saudis have a few dillion oil dollars in a drawer or two. Where is the Saudi relief effort to Haiti? How about Dubai, where they see fit to build the world’s tallest building as a testimony to themselves? How about Libya? Gadaffi is in the middle of a multi-billion dollar renovation of his capital city and airport after successfully trading the Lockerbie bomber for an oil deal with British Petroleum. Muammar surely has spare shekels.

Not only do I love Polly and Pip, but I really like them. They are smart, funny, and impossibly sweet. For example, Polly blows kisses to every animal she sees – in books, in stores, in people’s houses. She has also, in her imitations of Pip, taken to crawling around the house on all fours and pretending to be different animals, woofing when she is a dog and growling when she is a bear. For his part, Pip is currently in a stage where the sophistication of his thoughts and the language he uses to articulate them is rapidly increasing. Just yesterday he told me, while talking about our upcoming Thanksgiving trip to his grandparents, that “My heart hurts because we have to wait so long before going to Grandma and Grandpa’s house.”

Taking the lift up the third floor, we should’ve been put on notice when the first person we saw as the lift doors opened was a cleaner with a vacuum cleaner in the tunnel leading to the bar. But we persevered, and asked her if the bar was closed, she said it was open, we went ahead. To our dismay, the place was as dead as dodo. Deader than a dodo, in fact.
Steve Beckow: Okay, Lord. I look forward to that. I may share this with readers, and so I have another question for you, and that’s that I’ve said to readers, we may not be going through dramatic enlightenment experiences because we’re supposed to be serving.

Griffin and his “inner party” have continually expelled competent local organisers and succesful branches and promoted people not suited to their roles so that the party has never been able to function properly. It began almost as soon as he took over when he destroyed the very successful Burnley branch.

For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God; but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned. But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way (Hebrews 6:7-9, NASB).
The reality is that any nation that has a doctrine, which deals comprehensively with the universe, man and life, must be a nation with the need to spread this doctrine. Islam is not simply a doctrine of thoughts and ideas. Islam is also a practical system and way of life. Faith in Islam is not based only on its thoughts and concepts. A Muslim must also have belief in its actual implementation as a comprehensive way of life. Belief in this must then be followed by action.
All I can figure right now, is that I want to push through the rest of this week so I don't have time to just sit around and think. Getting back to work will give me something to focus on. I'm tired of crying and I'm tired of being sad and worrying about other people and if what I have done to them is somehow detrimental to their emotional well-being. I am ready to keep moving forward.

He was looking at me with a very wide grin on his face, showing off a perfect set of teeth. Alarm bells should have started off in my head but unfortunately they didn’t. Not a sound. I was focused on the instruments left. There were only mexican shakers left so I picked them up, one in each hand turned and faced the man with the overly wide grin and thrust them out in front of me. “Here ya go” I said, “you can have these”. He looked at the shakers, then he looked at me before finally looking down at his left arm, or at least, where his left arm should have been. He looked up at me again, still wearing that wide grin with the perfect teeth and said, “I would love to mate but I’ve only got one arm.”
Perfectionism also shone when the wedding between Joost and Jessica was celebrated five years ago. Two oude geuze were specially commissioned from the then (just) geuze blender Drie Fonteinen: J&J Oude Geuze Blauw (for the groom) and J&J Oude Geuze Roze (for the bride)- the former is a blend of 1 year old Lindemans lambiek and 4 year old Girardin lambiek, whereas the latter is a blend of 1 year old Boon lambiek with 3 years old Girardin lambiek. As expected when the best beer café in Belgium teams up the best geuze blender, the result is world-class beers. They are only available at the DHL, but in Belgium you can even buy beers to take away from cafés, a practice unheard of in over-regulated, stern Northern Europe.

It is likely that Tunisia’s opposition movement will congratulate itself tonight after what they perceive is a groundswell of support they received in Tunis today. They will read headlines in the Washington Post or Le Figaro and know that the world is watching their struggle. They are correct that many Tunisians are frustrated at the government and its ability to change things quickly. They are correct that the world is watching. But they are mistaken if they believe that marching downtown today will suffice to reach their voters. The lessons of October’s defeat have not yet been learned by Tunisia’s opposition.
We then went to the genetics doc and had good fortune there as well as we do not carry the familial gene for Down Syndrome. All of it did carry mixed emotions with us- we so wanted a child like our amazing Jack but at the same time that just carries to many health risks and so we were relieved as well. The doc said the heart should turn out fine when we have our echo exam at the end of the month. She believes that no indication of Down Syndrome will mean no heart problems, but I will worry just the same. I will never fully believe anything a doc has to say anymore, they sound confident and sure of themselves but deep down they will never know anything for sure as life and death is a roll of the dice.

Passing, 2005 is the show’s prize. A little field of found concrete and a nudge of sheetrock create a landscape which can be viewed through a small found lens, which strangely resembles the torn window wreckage of a downed aircraft. Through the lens the scene is somewhere between an Antonioni film scape and Duchamp’s Etant Donnés. You view a nun who has died, and coming from the distance, over a hill rendered large by the sudden thrust of the lens in scale come a young boy and girl. We are looking through the lens, a cinematic moment, but like with Etant Donnés, we are implicated in that moment, we are sucked in and somehow made responsible for what we are viewing, only instead of viewing the Origin of the World, we view a departed nun, a world lost somehow.

My debut middle grade novel, THE WHOLE STORY OF HALF A GIRL, has landed. On pub day last week, I sort of tipped-toed around, wondering if I was doing or feeling what I was supposed to. The world did feel different for me, but did it for anyone else? So far I’ve thankfully had the pleasure of getting some great reviews, but I haven’t heard much about how my readers feel, meaning the middle graders I wrote this book for. That is something I’m truly looking forward to.

The Fault in Our Stars (TFIOS, not to be confused with ODBAF, which I’ll be marketing as a patented weight loss formula shortly) is a young adult novel, which I’d like to think we’ve learned by now doesn’t preclude it from being awesome, or at least engrossing. The book is narrated by its 16-year-old protagonist, Hazel, who has thyroid cancer that has worked its way into her lungs, requiring her to carry an oxygen tank at all times because, as she puts it, her “lungs suck at being lungs.” One day at a cancer support group for kids (which she loathes) Hazel meets Augustus, whose only evidence of having survived bone cancer is his prosthetic leg. Equally intelligent, witty and jaded with the entire rigamarole of cancer and recovery, the two hit it off and ultimately fall in love.

For example, let's say a person buys an ebook and wants to make a copy of it, or change the format, or use it on more than one device. DRM prevents them from doing that.

On this day, you read something that moved you and made you realize there were no more fears to fear. No tears to cry. No head to hang in shame. That every time you thought you’d offended someone, it was all just in your head and really, they love you with all their heart and nothing will ever change that. That everyone and everything lives on inside you. That that doesn’t make any of it any less real.
Unlike you, the companies that mass produced the gum didn’t care what was on the stickers. Unlike you, they didn’t care what the flavour was, even though you know it’s that pseudo-strawberry you can still taste late some nights. The flavour didn’t even last a full minute most of the time, but it’s still indelible. It’s probably the fact that it’s so fleeting that makes it so memorable – the entire time it’s hitting your tastebuds full force, you’re memorising it so that in 30 seconds time, when the gum tastes like Blu-Tack, you’ll be thinking about that flavour and wanting another 10c piece, which also means another sticker.
Confession: I went off the rails at the end of 2011. I ate like it was my job and spent money like I was made of it. The holiday season has a way of doing that to me.

But then I thought better of that idea and decided what the heck, I made myself a cappuccino in my travel coffee cup, the beauty of having my own coffee machine. Then I casually wandered down to my car.

The census of 1870 shows Jesse, Nancy, and Jesse’s daughter, Mary, living in the household of Nancy’s younger brother, Monroe Corbitt. Monroe was also a Confederate veteran having served as a sergeant in Company H, 29th Georgia Regiment, and he had managed to retain a farm even through the war years. The Corbitt farm was in the 1148 Georgia Militia District of Berrien County. Jesse worked as a farm laborer, while Nancy and Mary assisted with housekeeping and domestic chores.

Forgiveness is not easy. It takes a lot of strength and courage to pardon someone that has caused you grief. Sometimes it is helpful to consider the situation from the other person’s point of view.

Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan believes we can place absolute trust in government bureaucrats to protect our lives and our rights. She argued to the Supreme Court that it would be perfectly fine if Congress passed a law banning books, since the government has never yet enforced such a law. I suppose she would also not oppose a law allowing the government to murder anyone it pleases, since the government has never yet attempted to make use of that sort of law, either.

He figured he liked green peppers on a pizza, but it was because it was all mixed in. So I search all over the internet but found nothing that was exactly like my moms, so I came up with my own. It's super simple, yet delicious and semi healthy at least. Luke LOVES it now too!
The result: delays, mistakes, broken promises--and, ultimately, closure, often only a few months after starting up. Here's one example, a publisher that opened and closed in six months. There are many more.
Hosoe's portraits of quieter subjects speak louder. People inform their spaces, and vice versa, no matter how plain the setting. Prints from the "Kimono" series are styled as exquisitely as Chinese porcelains. Hosoe accomplishes the neat trick of giving a fashion model the suggestion of an intriguing interior. Too bad only three prints are displayed; it would have been good to see an image of a mourning widow, a relatively public stance for a relatively private country.
Last year Carmelita Jeter became the second fastest woman of all time running 10.64 in the 100 meters (as well as 10.67). This year Jeter has stated that she has her sight set on Irina Privalova's "ancient" 60 meter record of 6.92. Her chase will begin in Glasgow. Certainly her PR of 7.11 should fall if her late season form of last year is any indication. I'm thinking around 7.05 in her debut. Of course with a decent start we could see something under 7.00 - an exciting prospect indeed.
"Those things are going to come," he said. "It's common knowledge people are going to suffer. Memory loss is going to come. I am ready for it. It's worth it; totally worth it. This is the best job in the world and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
For those of you fortunate to have waited out the 6+ months to see all of Bakemonogatari, and enjoyed it, then Nisemonogatari is right up there with it. There is no real story or plot to reiterate here, it stars Koyomi Araragi (Kamiya Hiroshi) as an average high school senior who got tangled up in some supernatural events from an old friend and became a vampire for a short time. He was restored, but retained some vampire-like elements, such as heightened awareness and regeneration. He meets Hitagi Senjougahara (Saito Chiwa) and helps her to rid her of a similar ailment that had been plaguing her. The two would adventure through their daily lives interacting more supernatural phenomenon and eventually become a relationship together. In the sequel, The black swindler Kaiki Deishu, comes back to make trouble, and Koyomi’s sisters, Karen and Tsukihi (Kitamura Eri and Iguchi Yuka) take up the charge to bring it down.
Hazen’s marketing entry swept the “decorative/display category” in the Association of International Metallizers, Coaters and Laminators (AIMCAL) product competition awards.
Everything is cyclical; the '70s never really ended. This album is deeply indebted to that decade, but less in the "Let's re-record the best '70s rock songs" way so many bands have tried and more in the "Let's embrace the sensibilities of the decade" way: it's hard to point to any one specific influence. To this laid-back but still rocking aesthetic Super Furry Animals (and are they animals that are super furry, or furry animals that are super?) have tied obscure and frequently surreal lyrical stylings: "Psyclone!" seems to be about invading dinosaurs from outer space. Whether that's brilliant or inane is hard to tell, but I know my vote is for fucking brilliant. Gruff Rhys's lovely vocals are joined by three of the other members to form lush multi-part harmonies, and the band is joined by the Catalan choir, and together provide the core of this truly incredible album.
Today, I saw that Operation Write Home is having a "Miss You" challenge. The funny thing is that, when I first "finished" the card, there was no sentiment. Then I thought to myself, "You can't have a card with NO stamping on the front," so I grabbed a sentiment set and, at random, chose the "i miss you." That's card karma!!
One of the first thing we noticed about the GTX 670 is its size and weight — or lack thereof. It may look like a standard high-end graphics card on top, but Nvidia put Kepler’s PCB on a diet. The card comes equipped to cover all your display needs, with two DVI outputs, one HDMI, and one DisplayPort. Flip it over, and it’s surprisingly short.
In the Protagonists' Cafe deep inside Kimber An's twisted imagination, the protagonists are having a hard time getting Kimber An to start working on a new story. They know, from experience, she'll only get nuttier if she doesn't.

4. Get ready for a showdown- You most likely got kicked out of T.G.I. Friday’s. Be proud of yourself, because that’s hard to do. You can either wait for the police, or call your significant other to come pick you up. When he/she finds out what you did today, it will most definitely be a showdown. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral will have nothing on the verbal thrashing you are about to recieve. But it beats sitting in a drunk tank, where everyone can see you pee.
The house I will be working on is not ours. My BIL and SIL live about three hours away from us. However, they run cattle here. They make the three hour trip often to check about the cattle and my BIL helps out on the farm. My SIL works for the Post Office and our little town Post Office was going to close when the postmaster retired because there was nobody to take the job. When I got wind of this I called my SIL to tell her. She put a call in to the big wigs at the Post Office and within a matter of a few days she was able to be the replacement. Since August my SIL has been living out of her suitcase and staying with us, my MIL, and my other SIL. They have thought about buying a little house here for years and now with my SIL working in town they finally took the plunge and bought a second home. It will be nice for them and my niece to have their own place when they are here.
“We can have the wedding in time for the children.” she cooed sweetly.
I hope you all had a wonderful weekend and a nice Mother's Day. Mine was quiet, but nice. My sweet husband cooked supper last night. My favorite - roast beef, gravy, roasted potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. nom nom nom :0)
I'm really really excited about my new job! I think the office climate and morale seems really good. I feel good about the decision to make this change! I'm also super pleased to be getting a nice pay raise.
But to top it off, I have to admit something. Something I'm ashamed to tell you because a dear friend gave this as a gift to me. Someone who reads this blog. He gave me something I loved and treasured very much and as soon as I get back through this year, I will buy again. My liveScribe pen was taken and my students and I have isolated it down to a 5 minute period when it went missing.

Tom's recovering but in pain, and his throat is raw and hurting from being tubed during surgery. He's thrown up a lot today, either from the throat irritation or what feels like a lot of phlegm that's lodged in there. Not sure if that's a side effect from the vicodin or what, but he's a bit miserable. He's thankful though, as he feels a million times better than he did beforehand.

My own recent make-up MAC purchases. I am loving this new Pro Longwear Lip Creme called Postively Dashing. It stayed on through the afternoon, burgers, guacamole, and sangria. Perfect for girls that don't have time to be touching up their make-up all the time. The eyeshadow is called Antiqued - kind of a red/brown/coppery color, and then Studio Fix Foundation.

The rains caused all of these to bloom at once. I like the abstract composition that I captured. I was on a step ladder looking across my backyard fence in order to take the shot. We have become a hothouse climate now with 80 degrees F. daily.
The lineup in the past has comprised of well known rock stars like; Prince Nico M’ barga, Peter Gabriel, Echo & The Bunnymen, Don Cherry, Drummers of Burundi, Ekome Imrat Khan, Suns of Arqa, Simple Minds, The Chieftans and The Beat. Over the years, as new talent has come about, the lineup each year has also become even more entertaining.

4. Let it grow. Once you have your plan set up and your business set up, all you can do is let it grow. Treat it like a plant, you have to water it every day and make sure it gets plenty of sunshine. Well for your business the water is your work to promote it, and the sunshine is the people who visit your website.
I love the creativity that Southern Star is bringing to the Texas game, and who knows, this may be a huge hit with the swine lovers. $5 says it wins an award at the GABF. Southern Star is well on it's way to being one of our more creative Texas micros with this pork beer and the really hoppy Pine Belt Pale Ale. The thing about creativity, sometimes it works, and sometimes people look at you like you're a circus freak. But I'm glad they are nearby, which means every new creation they push out will be in Houston first. Good luck fellas. Lay off that pig.
I put in a bunch of 12 mile runs along the Sawyer Camp Trail, a nifty running trail on San Francisco Peninsula. Most of them were timed efforts and several of them were with PARC, which meets there every Saturday morning. I'm not a fan of slow long distance runs. Do your long distance fast. But be careful, since fast long runs will take a lot out of you, and I normally did one every couple weeks to give myself plenty of recovery.
The Taiji fishermen are bewildered that anyone would find the dolphin drive hunts cruel, and consider dolphins to be just big fish, like tuna. They say that the dolphins are food for the Japanese, just like dogs are food for the Chinese and Koreans. The majority of the Taiji fishermen believe that what they are doing is acceptable. However, some fishermen told Ric O’Barry – dolphin trainer-cum-activist, starring in The Cove – that if the world found out what they were doing, they would be shut down; therefore they try and prevent people from documenting the horrible drive hunts.

"The U.S. has become known as the best beer nation in the world. This reputation is in thanks to the innovation and passion of America's craft brewers who have taken beer styles to the next level. During American Craft Beer Week our goal is to get 10,000 Facebook users to become supporters of the American Craft Beer Week fan page, and thus declare their beer independence," stated Julia Herz, a spokesperson for the Brewers Association.
He says some think of this event as “the attunements.” Others call it “the clearing.”
Although this is an attractive possibility given the central importance of alcoholic drink to high-status early medieval life (a lord’s hall is a ‘mead-hall’), it may not be the whole story. Translucent liquids such as beer, mead or wine would have obscured the internal decorations to some extent, which may argue against this use of hanging bowls unless seeing the decorations start to appear as the level of liquid dropped was part of the appeal (a signal for a refill, perhaps?).

"Final death throes"? Alexandria was part of the Eastern Roman Empire, which did not fall until a whopping 1038 years after Hypatia's death. Those are some pretty long "death throes". Prothero goes on:

I had the wonderful opportunity to see our school's production of The Wizard of Oz, and I must say, our students are pretty talented. To add to my enjoyment, my 4 1/2 year old grandson and his mommy came with. He's very familiar with the story and was a little concerned that the wicked witch would be scary. But he loved it. It's always so fun to enjoy it thru a child's perspective.

In her acceptance speech, Karman paid tribute to Arab women “without whose hard struggles and quest to win their right in a society dominated by the supremacy of men I wouldn’t be here,” according to an English translation of her comments in Arabic.

Brent: What an interesting question!
Silver/Navid/Liam- Silver tells Annie & Naomi that she’s getting her first mammogram done today and that Navid’s taking her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Navid tells Ade that he doesn’t trust Austin, and to make sure he’s looking out for her and not himself. Navid goes to talk to Liam while he’s getting ready for his premiere. Navid thanks Liam for being a good friend to Silver and Liam tells Navid to be there for her. While Silver and Navid are at the hospital, a nurse comes out to ask her some questions before her mammogram. One of the questions asks if she could be pregnant, and Silver doesn’t answer. Navid asks her how she could be pregnant, and she tells him she hooked up with a random guy. Silver says she’ll get tested tomorrow at her doctor’s appointment to make sure. Navid goes over to the bar and tells Liam that Silver didn’t take the mammogram because she may be pregnant.

Answer: It depends on the size of your pet, the presence of any underlying conditions and the amount of chocolate your pet has ingested.
There are also bikini swimwear tops that are designed according to the size of the bust. This means that all women with different bust sizes can get a bikini top that is suited for them. Some of the most common size based bikini tops are D-cup and E-cup tops. This is because it is normally difficult for women with these cup sizes to find bikini swimwear tops from the other categories. Therefore, these tops are designed with them in mind and fit perfectly.
For the last couple of weeks I've been blotting ink from my projects onto the pages of a book (after seeing the Queen of journalling, Dyan Reaveley do this) and also trying out distress stains and watercolours on different pages. Today was the right day to try and make my first page. Isn't it exciting how blogging extends your boundaries and makes you aware of new possibilities?

The tradition of Thandai a cold drink made with a mixture of almonds, spices, milk and sugar and Bhang ( female cannabis sativa buds and leaves) is specialty of Northern India though now a days its used almost everywhere. Associated with Lord Shiva and in the city of Banaras one can find people preparing Thandai with mortar and pestle , singing holi songs. The festive spirit is enhanced by the bond of togetherness it creates. . Bhang is also mixed with ghee and sugar to make a tasty green halva, and into peppery, chewy little balls called ‘golees’. Bhang has medicinal properties also and much safer than drinking alcohol.

The women could fair a bit better. A solid 1:59 run could get into the final. A 1:57 run should garner a medal. We have women capable of doing both. More importantly those that make the team will have the guts and heart to run with the pace and be in the hunt come the final stretch run. The summer should tell a lot about both squads heading into Daegu.
A rather curious phenomenon that has been observed in the popular press lately is that on those rare occasions when total global public debt is demonstrated correctly on a country by country basis, i.e., including contingent liabilities, as well as various trans-national, public-sector backed guarantees (such as EFSF backstops), and most importantly the Net Present Value of pensions and healthcare, or the cost of the welfare state expressed in current dollars, there is one country that is systematically excluded. That would be the United States. Today we set the record straight by adding the US to the list where it rightfully belongs, and also answer the rhetorical question of why the US just so happens to be consistently omitted from such column-chart based, hair-raising classifications.

Dodger? Scheming little villain. I wouldn’t trust him as far as I could kick him. Just as soon as feed him to Bulls-Eye than have to put up with his ugly little mug, his little sharp eyes taking it all in, watching what’s going on, storing it away in that nasty little head of his.

I have to say, it really started with winning the SCBWI Work in Progress Grant in the fall of 2009 with my YA novel, The Circle Journal (now titled: Chalk Houses). I am not being falsely modest when I say that I sent that grant application off with a very, “hell, you can’t win if you don’t play” kind of attitude. I am seriously still in awe that my work was appreciated in that way. I will always be grateful.

Sure, there is a dominant grapefruit theme, but dancing in circles around that resonant central core are a plethora of dynamic and delightful complementary flavour notes which combine to wind this brew into an exquisite frenzy of a drink experience.
Pattern Paper- Papirdesign
We have a section of our community which is disproportionately prone to violent crime to a massive degree, we see evidence of this every day, and yet we are not supposed to acknowledge it, even when programmes such as Dispatches reluctantly admit the facts. Furthermore, our leaders are actively seeking to add massively to that already growing and disproportionately criminal section of the community.
I'll admit I don't entirely get what's going on in the second arc, but the pacing is considerably slower, with nothing coming to resolution (so far, with 30 more chapters) and some things I can't fathom, like the current relationship with Kaname and Yuki, which should look like estranged marriage but is apparently something else? The style of drawing has changed as well, with it now dominated by a sort of wispy pencil type minimalist drawing and every vampire having the same somewhat empty eyes. Still pretty artwork, but nowhere near as powerful and with minimal contrast between the extensive details and the minimalist.

In 1963, my parents met and married, and my mother became friendly with her mother-in-law. One day, when my mother mentioned that she needed to see her gynecologist, Jovita revealed that she'd never been to such a doctor and had, in fact, never had a gynecological exam. My mother was shocked. She advised Jovita that it really would be a good idea to have an exam, and to start having them annually. Jovita agreed to go to my mother's doctor, Dr. Seissman. A few days later, my mother took her mother-in-law to the gynecologist for her first exam. My grandmother would have been in her 60s.

We went snorkeling both Wednesday and today, and saw tons of amazing tropical fish. We also were thrilled to be snorkeling right next to gorgeous Hawaiian green sea turtles. ( I can't take credit for the first three photos, I've never had luck with those underwater cameras.). Anyway, being so up close and personal to those beautiful creatures is one of the most amazing things we have ever done! As they are protected, it is illegal to touch them or harass them in any way. Just being able to witness them in their own habitat is truly a treat that we won't forget!
So, how does fear relate to love? My assertion is that fear corrupts love. “There is no fear in perfect love, for perfect love casts out fear,” as the scripture goes. If hate is love’s absence, fear appears to be an agent working against love, a force that is repelled by healthy, functioning love.

If your story’s synopsis has become your Achilles’ Heel, try simplifying it for yourself. Even if you find you struggle with road blocks in your story, this way may just help you past them. By targeting these four points you may just find that writing a synopsis can in fact be a key to the difference between a good story and a great story. Don’t complicate things for yourself by over-analyzing the synopsis. You already have enough to do with writing and finishing the story as well as submitting it for acceptance or rejection.
Decades later, my own daughter participated in a school haunted house at her grade school. My daughter was dressed in pajamas and was kneeling down with her hands on a TV screen that was just broadcasting snow and static. As people passed by, she would call out “Theeeeeeyy’rrrrrrrreee Heeeeeeerrrrreeeeeee” in reference to little Carol Ann in the movie. None of the kids going through the haunted house had a clue….though all the parents really liked it.

Kim Messinger, Janine Boyer and Shirley Brosius had a common bond of Christian service when Christ drew them together for their first small group meeting in January, 1998.
Below you will find 'Clue in 52 Seconds'. It is a very well edited snapshot of the movie that a guy did for a class and put on YouTube. In total it is 1:24 but well worth it. Better than the trailer. If you have never seen the movie give it a go, I think for many people it might have that Anchorman quality - meaning you have to see it more than once to really start laughing. For me, it was love at first Tim Curry.
I love how the Lord is aware of all things. Jeroboam thinks he is going to trick one of God’s prophets, when in fact there is nothing you can hide from the Lord. This can be very freeing to us if we love the Lord and embrace this truth about Him. Understanding this keeps us from trying to do anything behind His back (as if that were even possible). The Lord loves it when we acknowledge His omniscience (knowing everything).
In other ways, though, I still work in the same way. There has to be some kind of itch, something that haunts me as a writer, something that these techniques of writing help me connect with. Inevitably, I suppose, some of these itches and hauntings change over time, while others remain constant.
Luckily a second wave of punkish upstarts was springing up and it was these short, sharp, shouty and sometimes funny 45s, which captured my imagination far more than those old fogies. The Ejected’s “Have You Got 10p?” was a played almost nightly; The Addicts “My Baby Got Run Over By A Steamroller” has stayed with me (I taped it and mum asked if it was a infant or a loved one flattened); but my favourite band from that period were Action Pact, whose two sessions had me leaping off my bed to release the pause button on my hi-fi to record. There are two of their LPs in Peel’s collection, which prompted me to revisit them for the first time in since those boyhood days. Surprisingly they’ve weathered well, owing much to X-Ray Spex, which I didn’t realise back then.

We filled our plates and adjourned to the table to enjoy the bounty. Things were going along swimmingly for about 15 minutes, when suddenly T.A. began to feel unwell. The "bounty" wasn't agreeing with him at all. Now in addition to the sore throat, he had an upset stomach. He left the table to go lie down on the same sofa that Maddie had just vacated. M-t-G just nibbled at her food (no joke intended!). Ratchlet still had a scrunched up, pinched look, meaning her head still hurt. Not a good sign....nope, not going well at all! None of them were seriously ill, so I wasn't actually worried, but it was kind of a downer, ya know?

A wonderful lady, Gina, was kind enough to share her son's birthdays photos with me and gave me the "go-ahead" to share in my blog! She did a great job with the party decorations, too. Also, she offered me great advice.

As time passed and the teenage angst increased, I became rather wild and rebellious towards my adoptive parents and towards authoritative figures at school. I would drink with friends on weekend evenings and do the whole ‘hanging around street corners being loud and obnoxious’ thing. I went to pubs/bars when I was underage, I had relationships with boys/men and I became angry inside. I can’t explain this anger. I can HONESTLY say that I have never harboured any negative or resentful feelings toward my birth mother for the decision she made. I was also never resentful towards my adoptive parents. I was always grateful to them for being such good parents to me; therefore, explaining why I was so angry is difficult, because I don’t know why I felt this way or who I was angry with. Maybe it was because I had a lot of unanswered questions and I felt like I was going through an identity crisis.

She tantalised the village with her trays of peanut butter and sardine sarnies, Marmite cakes and ham & cheese with lemon curd. These dishes are not as farfetched as they sound. The human palate is strange and imaginative encouraging us to eat all kinds of disgusting things. After all the Belgians love pomme frites with mayonnaise. The Thais slather peanut sauce on skewered chicken. The Mexicans put chocolate in their chilli. The Inuits of Greenland relish whole small auks sewn into fresh seal skins left to ferment in rock cairns for 3-18 months. The English love cheese with veins of blue mould running through it. Who are we to sniff up our noses with distaste?
But then there's this other kind of "favorite": books created a shift in my life--either how I understand the world or how I want to live in it. But these are not necessiarily the kinds of books one can read over and over. You read them, they change you. Were you to approach these texts again, you would not experience the same tectonic shift, because you're already different. But by golly, you sure want other people to experience that transformation, too.
Things are crazy around here. On top of all the other craziness, I got a call a few days ago. My job just ended suddenly as of this Friday. It was always meant to be temporary job, but the sudden termination was sort of unexpected. On top of my Dad getting remarried at 87, my world is rocking on its foundations.
THE EUROZONE SOVEREIGN debt crisis is interlinked with a Europe-wide banking crisis. In 2008, eurozone governments intervened to bail out a number of shaky banks. But they did not carry out the kind of large-scale recapitalisation of banks that took place in the US under the Troubled Asset Relief Programme. Only eight eurozone banks out of 91 failed the recent ‘stress tests’, a theoretical test to determine whether banks can withstand another financial crisis. The big investors and speculators, however, are not convinced that all the banks are healthy. In fact there was recently a leaked IMF report which said that eurozone banks need €273.2 billion of additional capital. Lagarde commented that the eurozone crisis was entering "a dangerous new phase" and called for part of the EFSF funds to be used to recapitalise banks. This provoked strong opposition, some from political leaders who object to EFSF funds being used to prop up banks, and some from the banks themselves which deny that they are in trouble.

How has your weekend been? While the boys in our house were busy yesterday morning at rugby & rowing, I had a lovely time sewing away in my wee corner listening to Coldplay...it was wonderful! Hopefully I'll get the projects finished tomorrow so I'll have something to show you then.
I couldn’t be more impressed with Industry’s first app release. My colleagues and I can’t wait to see what else Industry has to offer as we wait in anticipation for their next release! Zip Zap… a triumph! Huzzah! A masterpiece! Dare we put it on the same plateau as the Mona Lisa and Mozart’s Lacrimosa? Does it sit alongside Les Miserables and the Statue of David? Does it have all the fixings to commandeer the Oscar from Schindler’s List?
Tell us a little about yourself. Like a lot of independently published authors, I am assuming writing is not yet a full time career. How do you pay the bills in between writing projects?
After a wonderful dinner we were back home all ready for bed and I snapped this pic of the tree with all the presents ready for Christmas day! Love our roaring fire?
This set the tone for the rest of the session.
She coped very well with the 6 hour-long trip in the back of the truck that she shared with the rest of her family and even though we had a number of stops along the way she was very glad to finally get out and really stretch her legs. Even though she did not compete she coped very well with the gunshot and watched everything with the same intensity as her grand-dam did when she was a puppy. We practised our heeling amidst all the distractions, and also practised sitting quietly at heel, watching the dogs working. She accepted fairly long periods of tethering while I was working one or other of the dogs which is a very important part of her learning, particularly since I will always have more than one dog to run, and will, from time to time be expected to judge.
Look for more blues this weekend as I paint the first Easter piece of the season, a large platter with either rabbits or hares, and possibly a few other creatures (we'll see how it evolves).
I made the tag with the new Framelits Labels Dies. The greeting, from the Got Treats stamp set, was stamped on a piece of Whisper White cardstock in Melon Mambo ink before being cut out with the right size Die. I punched out a tiny heart from Silver Glimmer Paper and adhered it to the bottom of the tag, then punched a hole in the top so I could tie the tag on with some Whisper White Baker's Twine.

Erasmus (1466 — 1536) in particular has been adopted by the forces of Christian and post-Christian yin as the patron saint of the European Community and its socialist-multiculti-Islamocuddly doing away with itself. But while all three Christian greats and others in their vein were ecumenically oriented, liberalizing opponents of strict dogma and deeply learned humanists, their critical inquiry was bound in respect for tradition; their analytical reason, by faith in the transcendent; their ecumenism, by discrimination; and their humanism, by the concern for the survival and prosperity of their own kind.
The shepherds heard it beating, surrounded by a brilliant angel chorus. The sheep and goats heard it coming from their food trough, tiny coos from a bitty baby. And when I wonder how in the world can our little tiny light reach such a dark neighborhood, I remember that the Wise Men followed a single star that led them to the Savior.
Guys. I went into this book wanting to love it as much as every one I know did. They all said that Amy is your average teen that everyone can relate to, but I really couldn't- This was probably my biggest issue with Amy is that I couldn't understand her. At all- More than that, I didn't like her- or most of the other characters in the book. I got that she has low self-esteem, but she NEVER stood up for herself. EVER.
BF: (crosstalk) Look, I have to go, but what I’m telling you is this.
Already, we see this racial and religious division everywhere. Surveys suggest 40% of British Muslims wish to live under Sharia law. There are constant news items about the radicalisation of young Muslim males in Britain, we saw the rejoicing in the streets of GREAT BRITAIN after the mass murder on 9/11, constant news about thwarted terrorist attacks coming on top of the London transport suicide bombings that killed 52 and maimed 700, constant news about Mosques selling literature calling for the overthrow of Britain’s democracy, the murder of British Jews and homosexuals, the subjugation of the non-Muslim infidel and the desire to install a global Islamic caliphate.
Monday: 5 – Not a bad pre-work run. After resting on Saturday and using the elliptical on Sunday, my legs were feeling strong. Of course afterwords, the achilles and ankle started hurting again!
This causes a state of intense disillusionment. It is only natural then, in the face of this unexpected and unwelcome reality, that some women will feel drawn back to prostitution, where at least they knew the rules, understood the functioning, and could operate without the new and frighteningly unfamiliar social rules they have since had such trouble accustoming themselves to.
Because this is the part of the plant's genes which determines whether or not it can self-fertilize, plants ordinarily have two different versions of this gene. So say we have a plant, and it's carrying version 1 of this gene or genes on one chromosome, and version 2 of the gene on the other chromosome of that pair. (All six Schlumbergera species have eleven pairs of chromosomes.)
Mesh Around is another event starting soon, most specifically on the 1st of June until the 15th and this one is a gridwide hunt involving some of the best, new and not so new shops on the grid working with like the name says, mesh.

The Reapers are tipped off about the Catalyst by the Illusive Man (more on why he would help the Reapers later) and are somehow able to move the Citadel from space and has it hovering over the city of London. This where the last mission, Priority Earth, becomes the most urgent and adrenaline rush mission you get. My final squad selection for this mission were Kaidan and Garrus. Shepard and your squad have to fight through the army the Reapers have created in London to get close to the beam leading up into the Citadel. As Shepard and your squad races to the beam, you watch people get blasted by Harbinger’s death beam (Harbinger being a character from Mass Effect 2). At some point, the beam hits or nearly hits Shepard and she blacks out. When my Shepard comes to, her armor is charred with cuts and bruises on her body and is near death at this point but she manages to get up and limp the rest of the way to the beam. For some reason you don’t know where your squad members are, but it doesn’t matter when the goal is to get to the Catalyst. Instead of any big, bad boss fight in the end to further hamper your way to the Catalyst you get to shoot some husks running at you before taking out the final enemy which is a Marauder Shield––easy enemies you have been fighting off as target practice in preparation for the big battle.

Last time it was mostly about dehydration and it was a quick visit. This time it was like a double bonus round. I think in general, I tend to be dehydrated, I had been consistently nauseated, and I had consistently been in pain. Putting all those three together, I couldn't maintain any of those by myself and felt overwhelmed.

According to its Director of Communications, Susan Obleski, as of mid-June the Susquehanna River Basin Commission has approved withdrawals from the Susquehanna River Basin of 98 million gallons a day. (That certainly puts the initial 0.25 million requested by Exxon from the Delaware River basin in perspective.) The withdrawals are predominantly of surface water although some underground water is being taken. The figure does not include water that the companies take from the public water systems, which they take without such permits. It also doesn't mean that the approved amount is currently being withdrawn. Not accounting for what is withdrawn from public water systems that amount is currently less. The 98 million gallons per day withdrawal approval figure is good for five years.
If you made it all the way to the end of the post, I have a request for you. I need some Bible Verses that relate to where we are right now. I would love it if you would send some my way!!!
Did they cuff you when they brought you in? Were they rude to you? Did they racially or homophobically abuse you? Didn’t get fed? Cell too cold? You are decent folk who don’t want to make a fuss but trust me, it pays to whinge and no matter how trivial and / or poorly founded your complaint there are people who will uncritically listen to you and try and prove the complaint on your behalf. Some of them are even police officers. Nothing like a complaint to muddy the waters and suggest that you are only in court because the vindictive Cops have a grudge against you. Far fetched? Wait until your solicitor spins it in court and you come over as Ghandi.

Marine engineering staff also deal with the “hotel” facilities onboard, notably the sewage, lighting, air conditioning and water systems. Engineering staff manage bulk fuel transfers and require training in firefighting and first aid. Additional duties include maintaining the ship’s boats and performing other nautical tasks. Engineers play a key role in cargo loading/discharging gear and safety systems, though the specific cargo discharge function remains the responsibility of deck officers and deck workers.

Poor Pleasance. What a godawfully atrocious last movie role this was. You can see his career dying with him every second he's in this movie. Every line he says is painstakingly labored and sluggish, completely forced and slow, and he just really sucks. I'm sorry I have to say that, but...there you go. Damn you Halloween 6, do you know no bounds of wretchedness? Do you have any mercy at all? You made me say Donald Pleasance sucks! My soul is forever scarred.
Introduced to North America by early colonists, yarrow soon became a valued remedy used by many tribes of indigenous people. American Shakers gathered yarrow for use in numerous medicinal preparations. The plant was listed in the official U.S. Pharmacopoeia from the mid- to late nineteenth century.
Technical: This time a simple one. Work with the opacity + saturation to bring more color to the stock picture. Added a few brushes, next I worked with some textures and as a final touch I tried this new thingy called Actions I recently download for Photoshop and I must say I’m quite addicted to them now, makes designs a lot more easier to make in matters of color effects and all.
Well it has been a longgg couple of months with the craziness of graduate school...and I have to say it probably won't settle down for a couple weeks until I hear about where I get an internship for the fall BUT I did finish with my first year of graduate school and I think that calls for a celebration (and a blog post!)

What do you do to keep this from happening? Someone told me that a teacher (in our district I think) tells the kids at the beginning of the year that if they have a name tag that looks new at the end of the year they will get a full size candy bar. I don't normally bribe the kids with candy, but with about 30 students next year that could get to be a bit cost prohibitive. Then what do you do for the student who moves in during February? Only give them half a candy bar? I can see some problems.
Cletus hurriedly made his way up the gravel lane leading to the DooLittle place as the persistent sound of gunfire grew louder ... soon he was steering the shiny police vehicle through the gate, and as he cautiously approached the DooLittle house there sat Grandpa in his rocking chair on the front porch peering vigilantly into the woods ... a look of dismay upon his craggy face ... his trusty Stevensen resting upon his bony knees ... spent shell casings scattered everywhere ... suddenly the old man brought the heavy weapon to his shoulder and leveled it in the direction of a thick clump of bull-briers Booom! Booom!! ... "what on earth is wrong with you DooLittle?! ... what are you shootin' at anyhow? cried the stunned policeman, his ears ringing from the thunderous blasts ... "why didn't you see him VanMeter? replied Grandpa ... then once again unexpectedly BOOOM! BOOOOOM!! ... Cletus tried to cover his ears with his hands, unfortunately a split-second too late, and was now certain that his eardrums had been split to shreds ... Cletus immediately sprung onto the porch and wrestled the smoking gun from the bare-knuckled grip of Grandpa DooLittle "now I demand to know ... what the devil are you shootin' at old man ... answer me?!" ... Grandpa pointed in the direction of the woods "are you blind VanMeter? ... cain't you see him? ... Deputy VanMeter slowly and deliberately scanned the wood line from end to end but saw nothing of significance "I don't see nothin' but trees and bushes Grandpa ... so what were you shootin' at?" ... Grandpa's answer was unflinchingly and unabashedly succinct "that thar green-clad lepr'chan!" ... well Deputy Sheriff Cletus A. VanMeter straightaway took a more thorough gander towards the woods! ... when the lawman turned back he discovered what he thought was the likely cause of Grandpa's "lepr'chan" sighting plainly sitting there between the feet of the elderly gunslinger ... an empty 2-gallon stone jug ... of which the intoxicating contents had been gradually transferred during the course of the afternoon down the gullet and into the gaping innards of Grandpa DooLittle ... who was duly and soundly intoxicated!
Oh, never call it loving!

When we set out to alter this well-established setup, nothing works, and we become frustrated by our lack of power. Eventually we just sit and wonder what’s going on. All we can determine is that it feels like we’re watching ourselves — and this inability to interact feels like powerlessness. But it’s exactly this ability to observe ourselves that creates our existence. Without this awareness, how else would we know we’re alive, we’d be like rocks. This is not a lack of power, it’s the power to create life.

Yahushua told them that everyone that His Father gives Him will come to Him and who ever comes to Him, He would not turn away. These are the chosen and these are the called. This is as forthright a statement of the paradox of predestination and free will as can be found. The Father has given certain people to Yahushua. How does one find out if they are one of them? Everyone is given free will and can choose and come to Him because they have Yahushua’s promise that He would not turn anyone away. When one seeks Him they will find Him, when they seek Him with all their heart. Yahushua is available to anyone who is hungry and thirsty for the Bread of Life.

We come now to encounters and combat, perhaps the most complex aspect of the whole game rules-wise, albeit in relative terms. This section of the pdf covers initial situation and the various reactions, and has an optional less random system for initiative which mixes things up a little. Certain details, like movement rates, may leave some scratching their heads, but the short section on adventuring at the end of the file, or a careful re-read, should hold the answers. Also, while the section covers additional aspects of combat fully, including fumbling or jamming, critical hits and the potential for instant death, there's no clear overview, so if you are new to this kind of game, I suggest reading through it all before attempting to understand any one element.

However, addressing dysfunctions within a dominant coalition can be among the most risky for a consultant. As with any performance review, it is not enough to generally identify a perceived problem. Specific examples must be provided, but done so in a manner that allows members of the coalition to save face. Often this means allowing coalition members a significant role in developing process-oriented solutions, while not forcing a “whose fault is it” discussion of the problems.

I know I shouldn't blame myself, and I really don't. But it's hard not to ask "why?" and it's hard not to wonder if I could have done something differently. Her last words to me made it clear that she considered me a friend - did she not trust in that friendship enough to confide in me? Or was she trying to reach out but couldn't find the words? Or was she grasping for a lifeline that day and I failed to notice?

The creature that dwelled deep inside Lyca forest was one that was simply evil. It was the worst type of creature, the one all the other bad creatures cross the road to avoid passing. It was thirteen and a half feet tall, and that was with the hump in its back that caused it to lean over at a slight angle to the right. It was clothed in robes that hooded the creature, that were of a most bottomless and hopeless black and ripped and torn as if they had been through barbed wire. Its face was one of terror incarnate, with entirely white eyes, slits for nostrils and a wide, gaping pit for a mouth that constantly hung open as if it were howling with misery. It had teeth that were broken and jagged, skin that seemed to not be large enough to fit its face and therefore appeared stretched and peeling. It was, in short, horrifying.

A nice spring feeling with a new floral cami from SMS and new jeans from Sn@tch. The butterfly crown is also new, at the Fantasy Fair: there are 2 animated butterflies, that gently flap their wings. The necklace from Yummy isn’t new, but very pretty, with little gold butterflies on a chain.
Given that the preamble to the Massachusetts State Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct states that “a lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system, and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice,” Murphy’s behavior raises some serious questions:
To their mind this is not what British workers are supposed to do, our leaders have spent years training and intimidating us with the 'R' word to the point where we no longer dare to question their great scheme. We are supposed to sit at home cheering for black football players and voting for non whites to represent Britain in the Eurovision song contest and to accept without complaint whatever ordure the great and good chose to pour on us in the furtherance of their aim of irrevocably changing our homeland.

Peter fell to the ground; his whole body was stricken with a coldness that went far beyond his body. His very soul seemed frozen. His warm delight at being a martyr for God was gone; it was replaced by a terror of the dark void beyond death. The whole idea of God became foreign to his intellect, and his will cried out for escape. Simon saw all of this and smiled, his mouth grew tighter and tighter as if getting ready to welcome Peter in Hell. He spoke aloud, “Peter, I ask you for the final time, will you deny Jesus Christ?”

He looks like a Rome. She imagined him dressed in armor and chains, leading an army of men with no thought to being disobeyed. Imagined him standing over the bed of a naked woman, ready to enjoy his spoils.
But once we were under the shade of the pines and changed into our swim trunks, we saw that swimming would be impossible. Out on the landing, where the sand sloped into the cool green lake, hundreds of cottonmouths sunned on the rocks and darted through the water. You flushed and looked for a place to sit, but they were everywhere around us, and even as we went back under the pine trees, we saw them under the tables and curled around the fire pit, slithering through the brush, moving through the shadows, all around where we had left our clothes.

Active media consumption is the emerging model for media consumption, where we have to make our choices without someone providing our options to us. Music is just one example. Netflix uses this model for television and movie consumption.* To a certain extent, Amazon has done the same for books. Even traditional broadcasting companies are jumping on board by allowing you to watch new episodes of many shows online or through an iPad app almost immediately after they first air. We’re still in transition to this new media model, but you can clearly see it happening every year.
Yesterday I did some catching up on my google reader and noticed that The Loonie Stampers Challenge is back up and running after their summer break. The theme picked by Wendy last week was School Theme. That inspired me to post this little project I finished over the summer.
Tiny white splotches dotting otherwise healthy-looking pink nails are not normally a sign of anything serious. Most often, those spots are the manifestation of some type of trauma to the nail. If you injure the nail matrix—the area at the base of the nail where new nail cells are created—you’ll see the results of that trauma show up as white spots as the nails grow out. But since it takes several weeks for those new nail cells to grow out to a place on the nail plate where the injury is visible, chances are that by time you notice a white spot, you may have forgotten the nail-slamming incident that caused it. But if you’re certain you didn’t injure your nails and you are noticing recurring white spots, there are several other causes—including the skin conditions psoriasis and eczema, or a diet that’s deficient in the mineral zinc (found in whole grains, poultry and seafood).

It has definitely been a little harder being sick and not having the extra help.
Carol brought a really beautiful card to show this week.

I'd be so delighted if I'd made this Carol, it's elegant and striking at the same time.

This beer pours a hazy golden color with one finger's worth of off-white head that faded quickly into decent spotty lacing. The nose hits pretty nicely on this beer and is full of pine, grapefruit, and other citrus spice, and only really a touch of caramel malt base on the nose. The flavor starts with plenty of hop bitterness followed by a big rush of citrus fruit and resinous pine flavor. The bitterness upfront settled down a bit about half way down my glass and then the caramel malt really provided a decent balance to the hops. I think this beer was brewed with only Columbus hops, but if anyone knows for sure please let me know. The wasn't much carbonation in this offering and it left an almost astringent bitterness lingering after the swallow. I am fine with that, but I can see how others would not like that in the finish. I think one bomber was just about perfect for me, and I would very much like to try the other IPA styles from Flossmoor.

But its coming people. Its coming.

Once you think you’ve kneaded it enough, put the dough into an oiled bowl to prove. The first proving should be for around an hour, or until its doubled in size. I couldn’t detect a massive size difference in my dough post-proving and thought that the recipe had gone disastrously wrong at this stage. But I carried on regardless, and after about an hour I transferred the dough into a rectangular tin lined with parchment paper. Push the dough to the corners of the tin, and push your fingers into the dough to give it the dimpled focaccia appearance.

Brown bottles filter out the light at these wavelengths and so protect the beer. Clear bottles don't; neither do green bottles. And although commercial beer isn't likely actually to sit out in the sun for any length of time, there is UV light in indoor florescent lighting as well. So although the required exposure time is longer, the effect can be the same: a degraded product over time.
Then I was asked my final opinion on the race, if the Democratic primary were held tomorrow.

A woman is someone who has to be courageous – when the man she is with cannot be the man he is supposed to be for her.
The language of the future is just as unpredictable as the fashion sense of their generation. But instead of taking this as a roadblock, I’ve made up a few of my own words and given an alternate meaning to common words. For even though the words will change, a teen’s need to be different and possess their own vocabulary will not.
* Got married and left therapy. I had been “at it” for almost 4 years….time for a break anyway. Had sort of done all I could at the time. Achieved much needed stabilzation from the therapy, and the Zoloft I eventually got on was a bonus. But I knew…someday…there would be more to do.

She’s the girl reading while waiting in that coffee shop down the street. If you take a peek at her mug, the non-dairy creamer is floating on top because she’s kind of engrossed already. Lost in a world of the author’s making. Sit down. She might give you a glare, as most girls who read do not like to be interrupted. Ask her if she likes the book.

But we have a few Roald Dahl books here I’m temped to just read myself ha ha. I also like the Dear Dumb Diary books, that neither of my girls cared for. So maybe you`ll see me on the beach or in the park with my face in a children`s book…and guess what I LOVE EM!

Recent polls have shown that many Americans think the economy is still in recession, and that more people have confidence in Romney than in Obama when it comes to spurring growth. The economy tops the list of issues most on voters’ minds. At his first major rallies of the 2012 campaign, the president explicitly sought to steer the debate over the weekend away from the classic political question “are you better off than you were four years ago?” and asked Americans to “keep believing in me.”
Hello, my friends. I'm not so sure that I like this new format that blogger has. What was wrong with the other one?
You plant and grow your own herbs, indoors, near your kitchen or outdoors in your front or back yard because of its usefulness. Now, you’ve been successful in your domestic herb or home herb garden, but how about managing it or making use of it? In this aspect, we need to do some ‘little work’ for us to achieve our objective.

You can communicate with your guardian angel through a number of ways and most of the time you have to open your third eye. People usually go to psychics to help them communicate with their guardian angels because the psychics possess the “third eye”. Though that is effective, you have to pay a certain payment to get their services. Moreover, that can be a little expensive. Most of the time people take matter into their own hands and seek their guardian angels themselves. We are of course talking about meditation. In addition, the experts say that this is the for sure way to communicate with one’s guardian angel.
I love that everybody looks ill in this cousin picture. Gracious sakes, we are in that season of life, I'm afraid.
Nietzsche’s overall attitude towards the theses of The Genealogy is contradictory. He exposes quite neatly and perceptively how so many supposedly noble ideas – good, evil, guilt, conscience, justice, purity, selflessness, etc. – are really methods of torment and cruelty concocted so as to maintain and defend oppression and inequality. Yet at the same time, he is clearly more enthusiastic about inequality and oppression than about almost anything else – his whole philosophy is geared towards a love for anyone who can and will treat other people like dirt and control them. And so in this sense his ‘unmasking’ of moral fictions is really a defense of them.
This is the best time of year for taking photos in the garden which usually inspires me to start a new flower painting- lately, the peonies have been calling to me!
I'm no shrinking violet, but I have met more people in real life by first making contact with them on Twitter than I ever realized I would! People in my own city with whom I might rarely cross paths but who shop at the same stores I do, walk the same streets. And so what if you did pass someone in the stairway of the parking garage? Would you really take the opportunity to get to know them? Certainly not. But because of Twitter, I know that guy in the stairway is actually Ed, he lives one street over from me and his wife likes reading! So I say "Hi Ed!" and he says "Hi Liz!" and we both win at being humans in real life. The local connection is vital. On Twitter we all talk about traffic, weather, what is that parade going by my window right now? It's like the walkie talkies I had as a kid, except back then no-one was out there to answer my 10-4 good buddy.
And your donation to my everlasting youth is greatly appreciated.
So this organised person has now done another clean out of the closet and playroom, finding clothes and toys and other things to donate to all of these people who have lost everything. It's a very sad time for these people and they need to be in our thoughts and our prayers to get through this incredibly difficult time.
My advice is to evaluate your sales team and find out the reality you face and build from there with the proper expectations.
It always amazes me that the kids can do this. They really can! Even after a doughnut or two. Even after hanging out in the game room, where ping pong balls whiz across the room and it's too loud to hear yourself think.
Melchizedek Priesthood: The authority to preside in the church and administer the higher ordinances of the church. The priesthood is organized just as it was in Jesus’ time. Consequently, the church was governed by high priest councils until 1834, and then in 1835 the First Presidency was organized and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was added. The addition of the office of Seventy completed the organization of the priesthood, though God took the next 150 years to tweak the organization, organizing, dropping, redefining, and reassigning the Seventies until He got it perfect sometime in the 1990s.
This is an early favourite of mine
I enjoyed this. It was a simple story but the performances as usual lifted it up. My God, Bill was a baby in this movie (I mean, by his looks). And I hear there was tons of criticism about his performance but I didn’t see anything wrong with it. Again, it was jarring more because he didn’t look like he usually does and yes, maybe he overacted a bit but there were times that really fit the character of Joe. Joe was pretty torn about his desires. I think this was my first time seeing Barbara Stanwyck and I liked her but the romance aspect wasn’t my favorite part. And Cobb was completely unrecognizable and his performance was great as well (I also keep thinking he’s someone else, oops). I thought the final boxing match was shot beautifully and the ending was moving.
A mockup of the Entebbe airport was assembled in the desert based on Mossad intelligence. The raid—dubbed Operation Thunderbolt—was practiced over and over and over. The clock was ticking. And time was not on the side of the hostages.

Hayes, a Beam veteran with more than 30 years at the company, will oversee the overall visitor experiences for special guests. Faust, who started as the Beam Outpost Manager in 2006, will oversee the Center’s retail operation.

I'm so glad to be back crafting!!! I promised myself I would take at least one hour a day to work on a project or post a blog, so now on to crafting.
And yet, the one positive through all this is that I don’t look old. I don’t look 42. I look ten years younger. Clean and healthy living, see?

The older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing, and hammering.About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer’s eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. There was no fence there at all.
The miraculous reproduction system of Rheobatrachus silus explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, since the whole system is irreducibly complex. Every step has to take place fully in order for the frogs to survive. The mother has to swallow the eggs, and has to stop feeding completely for six weeks. The eggs have to release a hormonelike substance to neutralize stomach acids. The addition of the extra protein-rich yolk to the egg is another necessity. The widening of the female’s oesophagus cannot be coincidental. If all these things failed to happen in the requisite sequence, the froglets would not survive, and the species would face extinction.
“It specifically cautions against using the Enneagram, which in recent years has enjoyed some popularity among Christian groups and has even been promoted by some Catholic religious communities. The Enneagram, a pseudo-psychological exercise supposedly based on Eastern mysticism, introduces ambiguity into the doctrine and life of the Christian faith and therefore cannot be happily used to promote growth in an authentic Christian spirituality.”
For the moment, anyway, there is no provision in the Rules for the role of disclosure assessor. Like so much else, however, there is no reason why parties should not appoint such a person by private agreement in an appropriate case, ”appropriate” generally implying that time and costs are to be saved by the joint instruction of a neutral person to stand between the parties, with an understanding of the Rules, the parties’ objectives and the techniques (a wider concept than mere technology) which might be used to cut down the disclosure burden.

I think of the the way humpback whales breach the sea with a snort from their blowholes and a wave of their flukes, and I remember how the water erased all signs of their passage moments after they dove again. Is that how it is for us? Do we slip crying breath into this world only to disappear, all traces lost when our time is done?
The study, authored by consultant Chetan Sharma, examined approximately 7 million patents granted both by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the European Patent Office. The data revealed that the U.S. saw a 390 percent increase in mobile technology patent grants, while the European market witnessed a 173 percent increase. Companies with the largest mobile technology patent portfolios include Samsung, Microsoft, IBM, Qualcomm, RIM, Oracle, Apple, Google, and Amazon.
He argued that Obama has shown no authenticate evidence to the New Jersey Secretary of State demonstrating who he is and that he was born in the United States. Apuzzo also argued that as a matter of law, Obama is not a “natural born Citizen” because he was born to a father who was not a U.S. citizen.
We sat in a booth toward the back of the restaurant. The place was about half-full. Diners sipped coffee and scooped up eggs (it was still before 10 a.m. on a Saturday — we were just early for lunch). I looked at a menu that had probably 100 possible items. My mom knew what she wanted: a hot pastrami. Coming in I debated between a reuben or a hot pastrami. I went with the latter. Meat is piled 2 inches high and sandwiched between fresh and sturdy rye. This pastrami has the right amount amount of salt; not overdone, which makes it hard to resist eating the whole thing. I left half of a half. The cole slaw is dusted with caraway and has a mild zing from vinegar. Our waitress brought three types of mustard (sweet hot, spicy brown and Russian hot) to go with the yellow bottle already on the table.

Trafficking for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation is common throughout Pakistan. Reports show that there is a trend of Bangladeshi girls and women between the ages of 12 and 35 brought into Karachi, where the buying and selling of trafficked women and girls takes the form of auctions. There is often a family lineage of prostitution particularly among lower caste families and girls may be pimped by their own mothers. In eastern Pakistan and Afghanistan, daughters of prostitutes particularly in the red-light district are outfitted with a natli (nose ring) at birth. When they reach puberty bidders vie to remove the natli, winning bids often exceed $1,000.

My wife bought me a non-dive watch for father’s day a couple months after I had sold off all of my dive watches. It is not a known name, not automatic, and not expensive, but it is the most valuable watch I have ever owned, because someone I love took the time to go out and pick it out for me. All of the others I chose, they were self-service, and they meant nothing in the grand scheme of things.
Arisa: An interesting character if not actually likeable. I don’t have to like a character to enjoy them. Her role was interesting, her motives and plans varied even if the cause for them wasn’t really established all that well… she wasn’t a bad character.
This leads to the film’s most common criticism, that it cheaps out on showing the horror that a viewer presumably expects to see based on the cover art. Unsurprisingly, I disagree. I love zombie flicks, but they’re samey in their special effects and “shocking” gore notes. They’re almost comforting that way, like a bedtime story you’ve heard read a hundred times…assuming your father was Jeffrey Dahmer. If a character on a crackly phone line describes an undead mob converging on a victim, I’ve got the mental image in place by the fourth word. If that mob is dog-piling on a family’s car while imitating windshield-wiper blades…I’ve got to work a little harder for it, and when the visual finally clicks…hoo boy. There’s no filmed scene that could ever match up.
I'm not going to go into all of the details about the wedding. I'm just too busy at work for all that. I'll post pictures once I get them from the photographer - who by the way was amazing!
4) Accept that I’ll have to go for a full 4 semesters plus a summer and take 4 classes in the Fall of 2012, 4 classes in the Spring of 2013, 2 classes in the Summer of 2013, 4 classes in the Fall of 2013 and 4 classes in the Spring of 2014 = 18 classes. Spring of 2014?! No. I don’t want to wait that long. Not to mention, that would then have me graduating in May, when most school districts start hiring in May and June for the next school year. I would be a recent graduate, with no experience, stressing over taking the state exam to get my certification at the same time I’m looking for a job. Can we say overwhelming?

I developed an interest in writing that has evolved into a passion. I can't do as much as I want to (or the kind I want to do) but that doesn't stop me. I am not saying what I am working on right now- that's my secret- but I'll say that my passion for writing has only grown.

I’m not saying that I’m any good at it, but I have always loved to write. I love how writing helps me to get my ideas and plans straight in my head and makes some sort of order and sense of the random jumble of dot points in my brain.
I set the alarm for 8am. I was due at rehearsal at 10 am. It is only 20 minutes away, but I knew it would take that extra time to convince myself to get out of bed.
Working with the cast and crew on-set was a great experience. Everyone worked well together even though some scenes where hot and stuffy. The cast was lively, great to chat with and we cracked some jokes. Lee Sales is a great director, I thought things ran smooth without too many upsets. I’m sure that I will work with the cast and crew again in the future for another successful movie.
The issue has fallen into entirely predictable lines with accusations of sexism and demeaning women on one hand and humourlessness on the other, and I've no intention of rehashing it here. Personally, I'm not too concerned about this name, although there have been one or two names over the years that I disliked. Not all women find such names offensive - one of my female friends delights in ordering Top Totty when it's on at our local, and Tory MP Tracey Crouch twittered "Why is a beer called Top Totty offensive & now banned from Commons? Not as if it is called Middle-Ranking Totty" - but I think we have to accept that some women do. It's no good throwing around accusations of humourlessness, which isn't actually true anyway as we all have different ideas of what's funny.

This is all very new for me. Despite my antics so far in 2012, this is the first time I’ve found myself in a dating situation. Mr Music (as much as I liked him) dicked me about. Funnily enough, he called when Mr Double-Barrel and I were in a cab on our way to the club to find out if I was still out and when I told him I was with Mr Double-Barrel, I got an ‘oh’ in response. Oh well. Time waits for no-one. That said, it would’ve been nice for me to flaunt myself in front of him because I’d made probably the most amount of effort with my appearance in my life. A little part of me wanted payback for the night of his ultra-crap leaving drinks. But I digress. My point is that we never dated – and while I did agonise over whether to text him, whether he’d reply etc etc, this is not the same situation.
New England Patriots DE Jared Crick (Neb) It was surprising to many to see New England quietly continue to win. Now they are ready to address their short comings after (my prediction) of losing to the Baltimore Ravens.

A seasoned adventurer, he enlightened me with all manner of new experiences in every realm imaginable. This day was no exception, bittersweet as it was. His late morning arrival in rumpled clothes from the previous night’s bacchanalian foray told me it was over and we both knew it. But, we were determined to make it a great day. Save the best for last; and we did…
You have to know how much I love Jack’s Mannequin and Andrew McMahon for me to attend this show. Sound Academy is one of the worst venues in the city on a multitude of levels: security staff are ignorant; the layout is full of poor sightlines; the sound’s not the best; and the location is ridiculously inaccessible in a city that, overall, is quite the opposite. But Jack’s Mannequin continues to book there on tours, and I sigh and buy my ticket anyway, because this is a band not to be missed.

In hopes of learning how to edit my novel, over the summer I read Scene & Structure by Jack Bickham. If you haven't read this book yet, I would highly recommend it. After reading it, I decided that if I am going to keep writing, I better learn how to tell a story. For now, I think this means putting that other story aside, and trying something simpler. I've started another story - one with just one POV character, and, as I write, I am trying to stick fairly closely to the principles I learned from Scene & Structure.

But in one respect they've been entirely consistent: They've all labored to increase the power of governments over those subject to them.

John wrote in the Book of Revelation: “They (the believers) over came him (the devil) by the blood of the Lamb, by the words of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death.” Testimony is mentioned between the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross and the willingness of believers to die for Christ. Now that’s unbelievably powerful!

This is hard. I follow a few dozen blogs, because I find each and every one of them honest and inspirational and entertaining. I’m also not going to choose the obvious ones, because they’ve already been TMI-ed (Snarky Snatch, Black Door Press, Love Sex and Marriage).
After trying a few different things, and eventually getting to the point where A was in our bed and no one was getting any sleep, I decided we needed to try to “cry it out.” S hated hearing him cry, and we had more than a few heated middle-of-the-night discussions about who actually worked and needed their sleep (grr!), but I always insisted that the end justified the means. Maybe it’s because of A’s NICU stay, but I know that there are certain things in life that are a necessary evil (shots, etc.), and that none of those things (have or) will affect our bond with A or his secure knowledge of our love and commitment to him.

My mother used to tell the story of when her family's house burned down when she was still a young girl. She was at school on the playground. The children could see the smoke from the fire in the distance. One of the boys teased her that it was her family's house burning Later my mother was informed that it was the house where she lived that had burned. When she got to the home site she saw that there was little left of the place.

I woke the next morning, feeling achingly sad. As you know, I’m normally a glass half full sort of person. I walked Moll through a churchyard full of the sweet spring scent of bluebells mixed with the pungent, earthy smell of wild garlic and thought how difficult it is when people you care about have to go away. Even when you know they’re coming back.
The main reason for the influx was, of course, the Celtic Tiger and the employment and prosperity it created. Economic migrants in earnest began to arrive from 1999 onwards, lured by a country with full employment in the throes of a boom. The number of work permits issued to third country nationals rose from 6000 in 1999 to 36,000 in 2001 and to 47,000 in 2003. After May 2004, with work permits no longer required from the new EU citizens, the numbers issued began to decline. Yet even in 2007 23,604 were issued, testimony to the continuing strength of the Irish economy. In 2008, as the economy imploded, 13,567 were issued.

We did a ton of baking this year, sharing with lots of folks. These are cookies that we made to take to some of our neighbors. Since we're in a "transition kitchen", there were several times that I would start projects and then remember that I didn't have my normal tools for the job. The night we decorated these cookies was no exception. However, necessity is the mother of invention and I learned several tricks that work great, including how to make my own colored sugar!

I was going to name this post "Let's do it Again" but on second thought....I would rather not. I had a shitty night and day and it starts while I was making this card. Who knew that while I was happily creating a card similar to my 'Purple Valentine', that something sinister was happening behind my building. A dirty criminal smashed the window out of my car, stealing my beloved E-reader. I don't want sympathy, but I do want my loss to serve as a reminder. I normally don't leave my reader in my car but I left it yesterday knowing I was going out later and would need it. My parking spot is pretty secluded and I never though I would be a target of something like this. I have replaced my window, but I guess I will wait to replace my reader. Please let my misfortune serve as a lesson, dirty rotten, soulless swine, are everywhere, and don't care how good or nice of a person you are.

In the course of the progamme, Perry said (I think I've got this right) how although he was pleased to be a part of the 'modern art' world, he was concerned that many contemporary works of art were less interesting than the buildings they were exhibited in, relying on the milieu of the gallery space to confer the aura of an artwork upon them. This was one of the things he liked about the British Museum - the artefacts in it were interesting in themselves. These thoughts were still kicking around inside my head when we went to the Baltic this afternoon. The Turner Prize Exhibition was certainly popular. The queue to get in was twenty minutes long...

This usually occurs within 48 hours of the high frequency being emitted from the ground based station (usually a ground based NEXRAD RADAR or similar produces the pulse).
Greenpeace even lost it’s tax free status from what was a very green Canadian government in 1999. This is clearly a step that should be taken by everyone against all of the green organizations, which is now big business. This may be changing now, but for years the green movement worldwide took in more money that 60 of the world’s nations, and no trade organization in the world could stand against them financially. That can only continue as long as they can convince everyone that everything mankind is doing is so destructive to the planet that it will become damaged beyond repair.

Planning is the ability to tap into the mind of God and gather the necessary details on how the vision He gave you will be implemented. It requires you to carefully do your research so you can effectively support and communicate the assumptions you make throughout the plan based upon the revelations that the Lord has given you.

Aerobic exercise is the best choice to lose belly fat A head-to-head comparison of aerobic exercise, resistance training, and a combination of the two reveals aerobic exercise to be the most efficient and effective way to lose the belly fat that's most damaging to your health. while resistance training is great for improving strength and body mass, aerobic exercise helps you burn more calories. What counts is how much exercise you do according to Duke University Researchers.

President Obama has already said that the U.S. stands ‘ready to assist’ the Haitian people. The U.S. Military is the only group trained and prepared to offer that assistance immediately. They must do so as soon as possible. The international community must also rise to the occasion and help the Haitian people in every way possible. Many people have already reached out to see what they can do right now. We are asking those interested to please do one of two things: Either you can use your cell phone to text “Yele” to 501501, which will automatically donate $5 to the Yele Haiti Earthquake Fund (it will be charged to your cell phone bill), or you can visit Yele.org and click on DONATE."

Tammy Maltby is a speaker, author and media personality with a heart for helping women to live rich, authentic lives. Her multifaceted life can be summed up in one word "encouragement". Though the gift of hospitality she mentors women in embracing community and connection though faith and food. She empowers woman to start simply but simply start! A ten-year cohost of the two time Emmy-winning NRB TV talk show of the year Aspiring Women, Tammy has also been featured on hundreds of radio and television programs, including Focus on the Family, Family Life Today, Life Today with James and Betty Robinson, The 700 Club, Midday Connection and CBN's Living the Life. She was the ongoing emcee for the John Maxwell's international THRIVE! events. She is the mother of four grown children, two of whom are internationally adopted. Tammy makes her home in Colorado with her husband.
The elder Lucynelle is a cagey creature. She does not have much in this world except her daughter and her crumbling farm. She feels a love for her daughter, she thinks. But, one wonders how a mother can in a sense sell her daughter into a marriage she does not understand. For what? … to have someone around to take care of the place. It is a good business deal but betrays the very meaning of the love a mother ought to have for her children, not to mention the love within marriage. The mother is blind to the sacred nature of her maternal duty to protect her child and even more uncomprehending of the sacred nature of marriage. Missing the sacred, she betrays it for 17 and a half proverbial pieces of silver.

Once the marriage was over and my new life began, I hoped that my children would understand why their parents divorced and the truth would be seen. I hoped they wouldn’t believe the lie that I didn’t love them anymore. This was a point in my life that I desperately held on to hope.

It may appear that I'm being hard on this brew (especially in view of the fact that I've already stated how agreeably it tastes) but given the reality of it's overall taste, look and feel, there really seems very little point in not emphasising exactly what you should expect from it. And the dutiful public servant in me does feel inclined to redress the reality balance in response to Badger's gently misleading use of the old 'S' word.

This tremendously ear-pleasing cassette came out on SSF Tapes (+tumblr blogspot) about eight months ago. It's sofa-king good. Bedphones is a one-man avant-pop project from the periphery of Chicagoland (namely, Crystal Lake, Illinois). The sound is pretty eclectic, with acoustic guitars, 'lectric beats, ethereal vocals, mandolins, and keyboard-ish stuff coming together to make a really comfy grey-day listen. (Not that it sounds 'grey' or bland, mind you, but rather it is something to keep your mind awake on that sort of day -- and we get plenty of those during Midwestern winters/springs/autumns). I've been spinning this pretty frequently since I got it in the mail, and it's one of those albums that just kind of feels good to listen to. Relaxing, engaging, and original. I can't speak from experience, but this tape would probably go great with opiates (*I am not endorsing the use of opiates).

I have been through the introductory class of all of my courses now, and one common thread exists: There is some level of disingenuous nanny-ism on the part of my professors towards their students. For the most part, my professors have been extremely specific in their expectations. After all, the syllabus is sort of a "contract" between the student and the professor. "This is what I expect of you, and this is what you should expect of me," is the general message.

All that was really left to do was eat one. Hard work, but I guess if I have to, I will just to be able to share my muffin with all of you. What a treat it was. I had to make a cup of coffee to really enjoy my midmorning treat. The kiddos loved them, I mean, really, who wouldn't?? Really, it was a super easy muffin to make, and I bet it would make a great treat around Christmas time in a pretty mug with the recipe attached and tied with a bow. Hmmm...gotta keep that idea around for next year.

Now let's get one thing straight. Jeffscape is not afraid. Not of anything. I'm quite serious about that. those who know him on the blog, see the arrogant shithead that he can be. Well he is a bit but he is not afraid of anything. He was extremely skeptical but always hopeful, came armed with a mini-maglite LED torch and was determined to either prove the existence or non existence of the paranormal. I on the other hand, don't believe in ghosts but the thought freaks me out and I'm slightly terrified of the dark. Whilst I'm happy to go on a tour, wondering around the rambling site after the tour in the wee small hours was not my idea of fun but I wasn't about to be left in a room where the bell hop had told us 'a little incident happened last night' so I clung like a limpet to the poor sod. Thanks to his royal intrepidness exploring the possibility of finding Mr Chen, his belt has now been stretched 2 notches since I grabbed the back of it for at least 20 minutes while he took me into the pitch black of the Asiatic Quarters. So, there's a 33 year old Veteran determined to find a spook, and a nervous (no need to know my age right now) 'unbeliever' who began to doubt her convictions hanging on in case he left me behind and trust me, he probably would have!
I have found out that I am very critical of myself. My current world is filled with self-doubt and uncertainty. Where did I put my notebook? Did I take my medicine this morning? Where are my keys? Why won’t the kids do as I ask? Where is the confidence I know used to be there?

What about a staff member that handles the enormous amount of required paperwork? If their salary is around $40,000 per year after FICA and unemployment insurance costs, that's another $5 per patient. So now, just to handle the BS and high insurance cost, you've spent up to $35 dollars just to walk in the door. Neither you, or the doctor gets any benefit from this, except the doctor may feel a little more comfortable knowing they might avoid an ugly lawsuit, or intrusive meddling by a bureaucrat.

The test was good, I panicked at times .. and got myself flustered when some things weren’t going right .. but I passed it and that’s all that mattered. The thing that calmed me down more than anything was hearing my grade for the previous assignment. I got a B- .. so the pressure was kind of taken off my shoulders for the test .. because I had a strong chance of passing the module as a whole regardless .. always nice to know.

I’m from New Orleans. I don’t say this in any kind of way, except to say that I’m from New Orleans – a very, very southern city that has maybe seen snow all of 3 recorded times in history. One such time was the day my middle sister was born in 1989. Another was last year. That’s how much it snows… that I can tell you the days with no hesitation. And each of these snow “storms” mayyyybe had at most 2 inches, although I wouldn’t bet my life on it.
It's kind of like running a marathon. You can plan, you can visualize, and you can have a goal. But, in reality, you have very little control over what happens when the day arrives. You take what the situation gives you, you push through, and hopefully at the end you can look back and smile.

Eyewitness accounts are scattered beyond this point - it is unknown how long this young man, a teenager at the time, hit Ingram, when or why he stopped, what condition he left Ingram in, or where he went afterward. A group of people was seen gathering around the victim, punching and kicking him, and another group (or perhaps the same one) was seen stealing money from his pocket and performing wrestling holds on his unconscious body, but by the time the police arrived, Ingram was unconscious and alone. He would never wake up.
Here are those 3 figs in their new home where they will overwinter until spring later on in the year. Behind them we have our 2 bananas and their “humidity generator” a.k.a. a Monstera deliciosa that allows them to have their own little humid microclimate.

We tidied out the glasshouse to prepare it for winter and its inhabitants for receival of the maximum light that they can get over the next few months

I also LOVED seeing how loyal and caring Tod is in this book. It just caused major "aww!" from me - even if he was less caring about what Kaylee and Nash had to risk to help Addy. And oooh, scary when he doesn't tell her how bad her injury could get, and how he dealt with John Dekker. But I think it shows just how he treats people who hurt those he loves, and some foresight to what will eventually happen.
Going back to the hardware design, we’re hesitant to jump to conclusions at this point, but we do know that these next-generation iPhones are definitely floating around with shells that look identical to the iPhone 4. Because a report claimed that Apple is stuffing next-generation guts into iPhone 4 casings to throw off leaks, we don’t want to affirm that the new iPhone retains the iPhone 4 design. In addition, a new design has been rumored based on recent “iPhone 5″ case leaks.
Why? Because of how you REACTED. You really do not have any control over 10% of what happens. The other 90% was determined by your reaction.

That someone, Gaelen, is special in his own way: he’s the last remaining Fey, a creature of the light, innocent and pure, the protector of the remaining joy the Fey bring to the world. Though attracted to Arthur, Gaelen is afraid to trust. He knows he’s being hunted for his power by a force that wants to overthrow Bacchus himself, and Gaelen will have to allow Arthur into his life if he wants to survive.

That scintillating double bill, by the way, included Catherine Breillat's latest film Bluebeard and Abbas Kiarostami's 1990 film Close-Up, the latter in a new 35mm restored print. Both films, by the way, are excellent. Breillat's film takes the famous story of the wealthy aristocrat with a blue beard and a murderous past and dissects—with her usual cool precision, intelligent provocation and atmospheric sense of danger—the emotional and sexual complexities underlying not only this fairytale, but perhaps of all the fairytales we hear as children but whose real-world implications we can never fully grasp until we are older and more mature. (Its final image is particularly stunning: gruesome and chock full of devastating implications.)
I've been developing this script for a while, with readings from the Madcap Players in DC, Rhombus in Boston, and input from the Huntington Theatre Company's Playwriting Fellows Program, and folks at the 2011 Seven Devils Conference (run by id theater).

The enjoyment factor of this show… it may not have been obvious throughout the review, but I fucking loved watching this show. It is easily the best ‘so bad it’s good’ thing I’ve watched in a long, long while. The trainwreck attraction of this was absolutely glorious, you just don’t get one on this scale like ever. The awful characters, the nonsensical plot, the contrived twists, all of it combined to make Guilty Crown outstandingly hilarious. Adding to the big joke that is this series is just how high profile it was – the staff lineup, the budget, the studio, the fact that it’s a noitaminA series airing over two seasons, which so rarely happens with noitaminA, it looked so set to be a massive, massive thing and seeing it fail this fucking hard was absolutely hilarious. I’m glad I got to watch it as it aired, and I’m sad to see it go because I’ll never get to see something as bad as Guilty Crown in this way for a long, long time.

In the final scene, Julia is present (disguised as a boy-servant to Proteus and obviously broken-hearted over P.'s pursuit of S.) as is Valentine, who is hidden and does not yet know that Proteus betrayed him. So ... in this setting, Proteus decides he's waited long enough for Silvia and tries to rape her; at which point, Valentine reveals himself and calls Proteus out for being the dick that he is; Proteus is all, Dude, I'm really sorry! And Valentine, who, remember, can't bear the thought of living without Silvia, says to Proteus, That's good enough for me! We're best buds again, and, furthermore, why don't you take my chick?
This time I'm probably making the other "typical" dish - cheese stuffed Padrón peppers. Now the authentic versions will use something like Tetilla (a Galician cows milk cheese) with recommended substitutes of Monterey Jack and Fontina but I've taken a slightly different track and used provolone.

When I lived in London I couldn't read on the Tube not because most of the time I found myself squashed up against a stranger's nether regions or else stuffed under their arm pit, it was because I didn't want them to know too much about me or to judge me in any way.
People think I don’t care. I forget important conversation, and it looks like I don’t care enough about people to remember things about them and their lives. I miss appointments, so I look like I’m careless and don’t value people’s time. I forget birthdays and holidays, I don’t start tasks, I can’t remember e-mails or phone calls or things I’ve read. It makes me look like I just don’t care, and I’m afraid it will ruin opportunities I need–social, educational, and vocational.
Holding the robin this morning, depressed me for a while. I twittered – appropriately – the report of its death and then wrote 1500 words of a rollicking yarn, without a single reference to birds of any kind.
The product is white, and comes in a handy squeezy tube. The Fab Pore (peel) annoys me because of the pot - I find the squeezy tubes are more convenient. I normally just rub a small amount on my cheeks, chin and nose, and on my forehead if I feel it needs some good stuff. I leave it for a minute or two then wash it off with warm water. It does make your face feel noticeably softer! I find myself sometimes stroking my cheek without realising. I've tried washing it off with cold water too, but it doesn't work as well and I don't get the soft face feeling. More like sticky face feeling. I've never personally tried to remove my makeup with it either (and I always avoid the eye area after my mishap with Clean Mary), but I should think it would work well.
You have made me feel this way…your love, your touch, your conversation,

While working alone at a roadside motel, Michal is harassed by the mafia thugs who arrive to carry out a scheme for their boss, who owns the motel, and Michal will be the unfortunate victim of that scheme. Fleming's dialogue for his bad guys sounds like he copied it from a bad 1930s Bogart movie; however, the two thugs themselves are very well drawn and one of them even has metal teeth which must have inspired the Jaws character who appeared in the film version. The hostage situation he describes is also nail-biting. When James Bond, after getting a flat tire, shows up at the motel, we let out the breath we've been holding because the brave knight has arrived to rescue the damsel in distress. Bond is quickly recruited to save Vivienne (not that it takes much!) and he does so in typical fashion.
I also took away all of her electronic items, until her attitude improves. Then I called my husband and told him in a calm manner, after taking deep breaths, what happened. He agreed with me, saying, “You are right.” Then he said, “By the way, what’s for dinner tonight?”

So now I am pulled towards a vacuum of no worries and okayness. Everything’s alright, until it explodes. By then, I will be worried and harried and buried by things I will need to do fast and all at the same time. When that time comes. Maybe I should just wait for that day.

My daughter is going to start pre-school in September and I feel like making some money as well. Buying a bigger house means bigger payments but we see that as an investment. It is very scary for me because I kind of had my IBS under control for a while. Less stress helped a lot but also changes in diet and I am sure losing weight has made a difference too. I am scared that it starts again if I start working again but at least I would be working in my home.

Take time this holiday season to rejoice, relax and reflect. Focus your energies on the positives in life going into the New Year. Focus on finishing this year on the positive and starting the New Year off on a positive note. Be grateful for what you have and what you may receive.

Scott McCormick: The book is based on a cat I used to have named Mr Pants. He was a very precocious animal who used to have all sorts of adventures in my old neighborhood in Philadelphia. He seemed like an obvious inspiration for a children's book; however, when I tried to write one based on his real-life adventures, he suddenly didn't seem very interesting. After all, in kid's books, animals do all sorts of wild and crazy things. Snoopy gets into dogfights with the Red Baron... Mr Pants once got on a Septa bus. Not very interesting. So I shelved it.

A selection of the above would create so much economic mayhem, the EU would disappear up itself within weeks. Yet in all honesty, I think there is barely a eurocrat or banker in the world that has given this likely eventuality a moment’s thought. In the West, we have become sanitised over three generations to the idea of massive socio-political upheaval. The mistaken conclusion shared by most dealers and traders – that the past is any guide to the future – applies just as much in the cultural sphere.

There is nothing wrong with all of the above and I agree with them all. However, the documentary needs to examine critically at the practical implication of the irrationals. From memory, there is only one instance of this, where in the case of communicating with the dead Dawkins is concerned with the mental states of those who have lost their loving ones. I would have liked to see Dawkins apply his usual scholarly excoriation to expose and bulldoze his way through all forms of irrationality, as well as mentioning some stories too. Astrology is not merely harmless as one might think, people do act based on the readings, and I think the quackery of communicating with the dead equates to a form of emotional abuse with these so-called mediums praying upon the fragile and needy mental states of people.
While we can’t put our hands on data telling a similar story for B2C ventures, our personal experience is similar: most sites attempt to corral the all visitors in the same manner… usually through the home page. The reality is this: whether B2B or B2C, the more you segment your audience into unique, discrete cohorts, tailor the value proposition to meet those specific needs, and UNIQUELY DELIVER when they hit a custom-designed/messaged landing page (just for them), the higher your likelihood to convert them. If you are new to this game, the Hubspot piece does a nice job defining the basics:

You can be sure that when he took his family back there, the folks were mystified and amazed that anybody could do this. They thought the horses and bison were real. What the artist himself saw was different: he saw the lines he himself had made and at the same time he saw the evocation of the animals in these lines. He was at the threshold of modern consciousness, which is a self-consciousness.

It terrifies me to think of the trouble they could get into and how easily their lives could be changed by poor choices. So what do we do? We pray!! We pray that God would make them like Daniel- that they would choose to honor God if given the choice…that they would always choose to honor God.
Right now, I’m trying to change this attitude because it causes unnecessary stress. I’m trying to convince myself that it’s ok to get these scores and you shouldn’t compare yourself to anyone. You should just try harder and improve the next time. And if you did yet you still didn’t get a better grade well it’s fine as long as you like what you’re doing…. It’s all about the climb as they say.

In addition to the complaint, a Facebook page has been created called “Boycott Hands On Originals.” Already, the effort has over 1,200 supporters.

Many critics have pointed to the ambiguity of the figure of the governess in Victorian fiction, caught between upstairs and downstairs, and John said he thought that this was pretty central to the ambiguities of this novel, and pushed here to a particular limit. With what seemed to him something of a plot manipulation (the governess not allowed to contact her employer), James forces her into extreme isolation, a situation in which she has no employer to talk to but cannot talk freely to the servants, not even the housekeeper Mrs Grose of whom she longs to make a friend but from whom she must keep a certain professional distance, resulting in a deeply ambiguous relationship. (We hear in passing that she is also isolated from her family by the fact that they are suffering their own troubles, to which she will not add in correspondence.) John pointed out that James often names his characters symbolically (Miss Jessell, was, it seems, a Jezebel, as someone else in the group pointed out; one meaning of the name Miles is 'uncertainty') and John wondered about the apparent negative connotations of the name Mrs Grose, as well as its possible meaning of 'big'. Could it be that the housekeeper is a more significant element in this story than many interpretations have allowed for? It seemed to John that the housekeeper who appears so homely and dependable in the (unreliable) governess's eyes would in reality resent her arrival in the household, having previously been left to run it herself, and having been very close to the little girl Flora who must now remove her affections to the governess. It is interesting that at the end, when Flora turns against the governess and becomes frightened of her, Mrs Grose 'reclaims' her, even to sleep in her room, and then flees with her, albeit it with the governess's 'blessing'. Mrs Grose might well, in terms of social and psychological reality, want the governess out of the way. Could it be that the whole 'haunting' is a setup engineered by Mrs Grose to achieve that very thing?

This is why I wanted to write about my experiences. My first blog post after the April accident was called ‘Normal service to be resumed shortly‘, because I assumed that was true. Yet here we are, nearly at Christmas, and my ‘normal service’ inches closer every month, but is still out of reach. It’s important to say that, thanks to wearing a helmet, I am still here and I do not have serious brain damage. In essence our family life has gone on as happily and fully as ever this year, so I am extremely fortunate, and I don’t want to suggest that my injury is something bigger than it was. However, the general ignorance (which I shared) surrounding concussion and its after-effects is such that most of us probably don’t think it is anything much at all, and sufferers can thus find themselves battling feelings of isolation and confusion in addition to the effects of the injury.
Anyway, moving on… after all that has been discussed in “Metrosexuality, The Modern Masculinty”, I still have my own opinion on what a metrosexual really is. I mean, based on the full meaning of the word -a man with similar attributes to a homosexual, like going shopping, getting pedicure, manicure, etc- I think people just give the term to any man that wants to look decent. That brings to my attention the question of whether we have lower our standards when it comes to the appearance of a person and whats appropriate. I remember I once when to a wedding ceremony and there where people in jeans and shorts just because it was the ceremony and not the reception. I can’t help but think that these people are the same ones that label a man in a suite as a metrosexual. Or even more (not to be so exaggerating) a man who simply likes to groom himself and look good without going to the extreme of actually wearing make-up and other woman-like products.

Thank you for all of the sweet comments shared on Twitter and Typepad about the makeover. I'm taking the rest of the night off to relax and spend some quality time with a husband who hasn't seen much of me in the last few days! He's been so great to keep the kids occupied, keep the house running, and keep food in the fridge while I knocked this monster out. I think he's earned at least one long afternoon to ride off into the sunset with his scooter friends.
On that same shopping adventure, I discovered something REALLY important that might come in handy over the next week as we navigate the shopping frenzy of the week before Christmas. The BEST time to go to the mall is at 2:50 pm when all the shoppers turn into pumpkins – oops, wrong holiday – I mean parents as they rush out to pick up their kids from school. Pulling in at 2:06, there was not a spot to be had ANYWHERE in the lot. I circled the rows of cars near the mall entrance where I knew the kiosk I had to visit was (so I could go in for the kill and make a quick exit) but there were no empty spots. Widening my range with each pass, I followed present-laden shoppers walking (most wandering lost) through the parking lot, looking for their cars. Inevitably, every one suddenly switched direction, cutting through to the next row (something you can’t do in a car) as they spotted their vehicle… The lucky car circling for the 19th time in that row wins the prize, drats! I finally lucked out with a distant spot being vacated by a cabbie who failed to draw the attention of other hopeful parkers because he backed in to his spot, so he packed his trunk with shopping bags inconspicuously and, as luck would have it, conveniently started ‘er up just as I made my approach. I was in and out of the mall with my Christmas cache by 2:50 pm and, behold, the lot was EMPTY! There were tons of spots right up front! If I had known, I might have had Sarge pick up the Old Soul and stayed to do more shopping (hah, as if)! Then again, the long walk did me good considering those first 10 pounds I’m still trying to lose.
So we really hope you'll play!

One more thing, because the Chapel is a functioning one, it remains a holy place and so the guards periodically let out a mighty ‘Shhhhhh’ in unison. It would resonate and was quite powerful. Though it worked for a time, it was like putting a lid on a boiling pot. The pressure would eventually build and the lid/talking would eventually rise again. But I loved that they did not give up.

Homegrown talent from the area is pretty thin on the ground. In the late '70s it was cover band hell, and although the OC hardcore sound and look took hold amongst the surf grommets in the early '80s, any punk bands that did form unfortunately never released anything, at least until Asylum in the mid '80s. There are only four (and a half) records from the Gold Coast from the era we cover, and only two we'd consider documenting. Apologies to the Ballistics, Sigh Of Relief and Squadron Leader. This 'un sees a band straddling Joy Division's transition into New Order. The vocals and guitar echoing the former, with the latter being represented by the strong rhythm section and the synth. "Hey, press that button that makes a sound like steam escaping again". We take the piss, but note that this one has survived the cull pile here on several occasions over the last few decades. Something keeps drawing us back. Needless to say it's not the further transition into new romantic horse shit evident on YouTube.
I did the research because I was interested in the effect that today’s strongly-gendered parenting might have on the adults who live in the color-coded worlds of their children. Also, I was looking for a simple way to test whether, or to what extent, color preferences were variable in adulthood (rather than genetic), and the gender of children seemed like a good, mostly-random experiment to test that.

I love salmon. It is versatile, healthy and easy to make. Salmon lends itself to so many versatile flavor profiles.

On March 23, 1989 in Salt Lake City, the University of Utah held a press conference to announce the discovery of cold fusion, but the story had already been leaked to the world's most influential financial dailies, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. Both papers continued to print unfailingly optimistic reports for weeks. Among those lured into the swamp was Randell Mills, a 1986 graduate of Harvard Medical School. Two years later Mills held a press conference of his own to announce that it wasn't fusion. It was better! Hydrogen atoms can shrink into "hydrinos," releasing energy. With the 17th anniversary of cold fusion approaching, both papers are now running credulous stories about Mills and his company, BlackLight Power. BLP, which has never produced anything, is rumored to be preparing an IPO.

And that’s because this is a jokey and campy update of the serious Gothic material presented there. The themes, tropes and situations of the much-cherished series have been spun to support an entirely Burton-esque fish-out-of-water comedy, but one lacking the heart and emotionality of Big Fish (2002) or Edward Scissorhands (1992). Barnabas -- the great Byronic vampire who came before Anne Rice’s Lestat, Forever Knight’s Nick Knight, Joss Whedon’s Angel and Stephanie Meyers’ Edward Cullen – is now a confused misfit tilting at lava lamps and other fads of the 1970s.

I believe that there is something for everyone, but certain factors can't help but influence peoples' buying habits in general. Constant talk in the media of purse strings naturally makes us more aware and more protective of them. But people still want to be creative, to enhance their surroundings, acquire something unique and irreplaceable, and what I have noticed recently is perhaps the more unique the better.

So, after several dress fittings (I ended up with that ghastly frill around my arms when it was decided, without my knowledge, that the dress would be a little too risque without something on my arms), I paraded down a raised platform at the Jackson Country Club on my father's arm on the Friday after Thanksgiving, 1986, and then was forced to attend several Deb parties over the Christmas holidays that were redeemed only by the vast amount of alcohol that was offered at each one.
I post this picture simply for posterity, it's also somewhat cathartic. I am not a 'ticker' and am quite aware of the nonsense of lording it up and showing off about nicely flavoured liquids. But there's something to be said for having more booze than you can nail in one session in your house.

Adorable, aren't they? I likely feel very positive about them because I haven't yet worked on the garden.
The biggest surprise of the night was when I wandered over to the English Bar and had a taste of Theakston’s Best Bitter from the wooden cask. You could really taste the oak of the cask, which permeates the poor little 3.5% beer giving it all sorts of whisky-like flavours. I’m not having a laugh here; Theakston’s may be unfashionable among beer nerds but they should give this one a go – several Theakston beers are available from the wood (I haven’t yet tested the other casks for oakiness).

My room was on the nice side of the sort of thing I’m used to but then I rarely travel in style. It was in possession of both a television and a kettle so I decided to make a cup of the available green tea and see what Chinese people watch for entertainment. I was only mildly surprised to be greeted by a tightrope walking dog on the very first channel; the programme seemed to bridge a gap between Crufts and Ninja Warrior that I had hitherto thought unbridgeable. After such glorious beginnings the rest of the exhausting number of channels delivered nothing but cold anti-climax in a language I didn’t speak.
The layers of undergarments worn in the 18th century created a protective barrier between one's body and the world. The panier in this sculpture spans nearly four feet at the base making it awkward to move as I found out when I tried on the outfit. As well, I gained an appreciation for why 18th century women needed help to dress! (I photographed myself wearing my creations and showed these self-portraits to Christopher who thought them worthy of being blown up life-size a la Cindy Sherman. That's my next project! In the meantime, here is a documentation photo of the dress.)

However, later in the day I went to Detroit to go to the North American International Auto Show, and in order to get to the People Mover, I had to walk through the Greektown casino (I didn't gamble). And guess what? I got carded. So I guess in the end, yesterday was a wash, age wise.
OK, I should totally be working on the edits for my book, but I have about as much concentration as a puppy with ADD that just sucked down a butt load of pixie sticks right now (I like to create an image for my readers...you're welcome:), so I decided to blog instead.

The best thing about cycling in France in undoubtedly the patisseries found in each village, where I consume various gastronomic delights each day. Every time I ride into a new town at lunchtime I seek out the nearest shop and watch where all the locals buy their bread. I still cannot work out what exactly the French do with their baguettes; everyone seems to visit the patisserie twice a day and leave with hands full of bread. I guess I have a certain lack of creativity… at the moment my baguette meals involve dipping the bread into a vegemite jar – yum! It was while having such a meal outside the Somme Museum in Albert that Garry and Dianne took pity on me and kindly bought me lunch. I needed the energy too after going off road along La Somme on a dirt track later in the day.

However, if I’m being honest with myself, I’d much rather be with the Hawaiians on this and ‘hang loose’ – or to quote my sister, the infinitely wise starlet and ‘calm the f**k down.’ Therefore, when things of a tough, challenging nature come up, whether that’s a fight with said starlet, a stressful moment in work, or the frustration I feel at a horrendous news story, then I’m going to be handing it over. Be warned this isn’t a quick fix to a situation and I reckon it’s a lifelong practice, but it is so worth it!

It would be overstated to suggest that the Volt is a "loss leader" in the traditional sense, or that the Plymouth convertible was a "bait and switch" tactic. Still, there are tantalizing points of similarity. In the auto industry as well,the interrelationship among the mark, the brand and the product are at once both more and less than that which meets the eye.

Lord Bingham said, in brief that; the offence is complete when the message is sent (no proof of receipt required) [at para.8] – but, more critical that the intention was to “prohibit the use of a service provided and funded by the public for the benefit of the public for the transmission of communications which contravene the basic standards of our society.”

Besides, your friend said he’d make it up to you. You aren’t sure what that means, but it must be something good. Thirty minutes later a car pulls up in the driveway. Someone you don’t know is driving. This person walks over and informs you that your friend has been delayed. “Would you mind holding the rock for just a little while longer?” he asks.

She climbed up on bed, and traced her fingers along my neck and over my breasts. She gave it a slight squeeze and I inhaled softly. Her warmth, her kiss, her touch. It was perfect. ”I love you,” she whispered into my ear and licked it with her tongue. The wet, slippery sound sent shivers down my spine. Her hand reached down and I felt her warmth as she rubbed my cold, wet skin making me release another flow of wetness. The pleasure it gave me was immense.

My Review: About a decade ago, The Sword of Truth novels were top sellers at the college bookstore where I worked. So, when I found a special edition of Wizard's First Rule, the first book in the series, I purchased it, shelved it, and promptly forgot I owned it. Then, a few years ago, ABC produced a TV show called Legend of the Seeker that was based on The Sword of Truth series. Now, normally I’m one of those people who likes to read the books before watching the television version, but in this instance I made an exception. You see, the male lead, Richard Cypher, was hot. Go ahead. Google him if you don't believe me.
And while the almost constant stream of protest marches can be a tad annoying, you have to admire the average French person's fervent belief that taking to the streets is an effective way to have their voice heard. You may not like the fact that your Vespa ride across the city is interrupted by yet another bunch of chanting refuseniks, but you respect the attachment to and belief in democracy that spurs them on.

An icon of the labor movement, Mother Jones: Raising Cain and Consciousness, is the subject of a biography by Simon Cordery ($21.95, University of New Mexico Press, softcover). Mary Harris was born into a family of Irish radicals in 1837. Like thousands of others, the Irish potato famine forced them to immigrate to Canada. She married George Jones and settled with him Memphis, only to lose him and their four children to a yellow fever epidemic in 1867. She then lost her dressmaking business to the great Chicago fire in 1871. She found a home in the emerging labor movement after that, crisscrossing the nation to be an organizer. By all accounts she was a force to be reckoned with and in time she gained a national reputation in mines, factories, and workshops across the nation. There’s even a magazine named after her these days. If you have heard of her but never knew how she gained her reputation, this book will prove of interest as part of America’s history.
I've decided to start answering all of his questions with the same question in response. "Well, what do you think you should do?" And then critiquing his responses. Throw that passive/aggressive bullsnap right back in his face and make him decide for himself.
Australian money, however, holds value. Although I still have no idea how a small piece of plastic can be worth $100, at least our gold reserves match with the physical money printed.
Grace Cheval & Dylan Moore
So, I have this idea for a short story. It's basically a father discovering that his son has started playing a new and involved game. In an effort to be a better parent, he decides to start playing himself... and becomes the first adult to discover that some of the more wildly fanciful elements that his son has told him about (talking game-pieces, otherworldly battles, etc.) are true.
They both turned off their headlights when I got to the end of the first field. The moon gave me just enough light to see the remaining corn stalks I had to jump.
By making such comments Naik is clearly guilty of shirk, or the sin of associating partners with Allah, for ascribing some of Allah’s names and attributes to true prophets like Moses and also to the false prophet Muhammad, thereby elevating them to the level of divinity.
Buller won't get out of the van. He has been clinging to his Colorado river rock on the dashboard of our van since we returned. Seems he misses Denmark, and he misses you Sabin. Buller wants to come home. Although it is a strange time for a robin to fly North (most are gone for the winter now) we are wondering if Early is ready to fly the coop too?
The Nightmare Man. Series 4, episode 1.
Reader, let me talk to you about this subject. Believe me it is one of the deepest importance. This is no mere question of controversy. This is not one of those points on which men may agree to differ, and feel that differences will not shut them out of heaven. A man must be right on this subject, or he is lost forever. Heaven or hell, happiness or misery, life or death, blessing or cursing in the last day,—all hinges on the answer to this question, “What do you think about the cross of Christ?”

There are a few Beastie classics that get heavy airplay during the roughly 8 hours I spend in my car during the week (notably the palliative Namasté ). But Paul’s Boutique is an album I hadn’t listened to in years. I’m glad I got to take a trip down memory lane and revisit this timeless classic.
PS. In order to level-out the karma, I have been asked to tell you that on the 11th June, from 1.30 to 4pm, Drolma Buddhist Centre is hosting an open day in Dogsthorpe, Peterborough.
Several attempts at locating my phone and one full-on search and rescue mission later, my phone was found between the couch cushions, which coincidentally seems to be its favorite place to hide. With all of the running around I’ve been doing lately, spending 20 minutes looking for my phone before I can get my kiddos to baseball practice or an afterschool event is not an option.

and I will be out in California setting up my table for the Halloween and Vine show on Saturday, Sept. 24th. Just the thought of this is making me a bit nervous for a couple of reasons.

Promise lived the life of Riley here on the farm, she was an Alpha mare who got along with everyone. She loved "cookies" ( horse treats, esp the peppermint ones) All I had to do was call for her saying Promise, want a cookie? and she could be at the end of our 6 acres and she would come a runnin... it was so delightful to watch her get her "groove on" and do that beautiful floaty trot Arabians in all their glory are so good at doing. Her tail flung over her back, hocks and knees pistoning, neck proudly arched... majestic to watch.... spellbinding. Promise had her own winter blanket, and the past couple of years has loved when I headed outside with her blanket to cover her for the winter. I remember one night coming home to do chores and Promise was standing so still, I couldn't figure out why until I got near her, since it was dark I couldn't see that she had her back legs wrapped in wire, she could have panicked but she didn't, she waited for me to quietly untangle her legs from that mess of wire.

See, he told me I needed an MRI and a spinal tap, and probably a medication that would reduce the optic nerve swelling while I lose the weight. I scheduled the MRI, but when I filled out the paperwork, I saw that they won't bill for deductible/co-pay. I called to verify. They wanted $658 at the time of my appointment. Sorry, please cancel my appointment, I can't do that. The fantastic person on the other end hung up on me. BEYOND ignorant and rude. I won't be going there for anything. (I'm bitter, can you tell?)
I hope that's wetted you appetite. They really are beautiful stamps to play with and very versatile as you can see. There are a lot of separate images that build up into any scenes your imagination can create. I've just coloured some with promarkers and of course the messy distress inks had an outing too.
I won’t be sitting on my couch, watching tv-aside from late night episodes of Sex and the City and The Nanny (brilliant shows.) And I will be eating three times the amount of fruit I am eating now. Those are my…promises of sorts to myself, and to whoever is reading this now. Those aren’t even the big changes, the big change is yet to come but-it will come-and when it does, I’ll let you all know exactly what it is, narration and pictures and all.

Isn't this just another boring article illustrating the left's enduring fetish about Nazis? The Nazi Party and its acolytes were utterly destroyed over 65 years ago and its leading lights were killed or imprisoned. Either way Nazism was totally discredited as a creed while the architects of the left's monstrous (and in many ways greater) crimes suffered no such fate. Yet in the best traditions of Joseph Mccarthy, the UK left would have you believe that there are closet Nazis everywhere....in, under and on the bed. It's utter self-serving b******s which enables them to shift attention from the crimes committed by the left.

Taking responsibility and making personal adjustment would be ridiculous, right? These “surprised” investment gamblers are like pregnant women who act mystified when “suddenly” their water breaks. “Who knew? I was confident that this company was doing fine, and then they filed bankruptcy. Who is to BLAME for this shocking development… which, by the way, was obviously unpredictable (and which I may have been explicitly warned about for several years now)?”
I decided to check out the shoot on the day and was basically just a general assistant. I don’t know how she did it, but Jade managed to find the most perfect clothes and accessories for her ”Mermaid Out of Water” concept. Mostly all from second-hand stores! (Yes, we love that). My particular favourites were the shimmering gold skirt, the perlemoen shell bra, and the big blue goggles. The model, Nicky Fraser, was also unbelievably perfect for the mermaid role, with her wiry, curly hair and long slender physique, she was stunning!
We pass by what appears to be an enclosed training area. Through the plate-glass window, we can see a man-sized dummy. Suddenly, a blur of brown fur streaks across the room, moving so fast we can barely make it out. It bounces off the walls, does a backflip and then a brief, ever-so-fast glint of metal flashes. The head of the dummy pops off, sliced cleanly at the shoulders. And even before the ball of brown actually lands, another glint of metal and THUNK. The dismembered dummy head is speared onto the opposite wall by a giant, 8 inch combat knife. The ball of fur turns towards us. All we see are two crazy eyes and two giant teeth.
Creating an emotional tie between the product or service your company sells and your client or consumer, seems to be a mutually beneficial practice for corporations and charitable entities. Will this marketing trend towards Sustainability and Cause Marketing continue? If companies truly commit to incorporating Sustainability and/or Cause Marketing in their marketing strategies, and these efforts result in client or customer allegiance and brand preference, my opinion is that it’s likely we’ll see these marketing trends become standard practices.
Ancient societies around the world used honey as an energy food. It has evolved as a unique and powerful remedy for a wide variety of complaints.

Being Jewish, Kugel finds himself in a bind. The tattoo on her arm confirms that the woman is indeed a Holocaust survivor, even if she isn’t Anne Frank. Will Kugel be the man to be identified as the Jew who threw a survivor out of his house? And what if the woman really is Anne Frank?

3. Pare the potatoes and onions and dice them. Add them, plus the carrots, green peppers, cabbage, tomato puree, corn, red pepper, okra, parsley, lima beans, celery, and bourbon, to the meat and stock. Allow the stew to simmer until very thick about 6 hours.
Again, to take a flash photo, I went to a place that was a little darker (but not dark, I took this photo around noon in summer, so you can imagine, no dark places) and my pupils are bigger and you can practically only see the lens design, not my eye color again. I think the blending is amazing in this series and Green and Gray ones would look so dramatic and amazing, yet blend really great on dark eyes!!! I like how they turn up the green in my eyes and make the size bigger! Also very comfortable!
These thoughts are never over. They aren’t. It is a thought that is continuous, unfortunately, and all we can ever ask for is a change of weather.

We wrapped up at the bandstand, a big "Hey, that's our show, we'll be going to more breweries, bars, and festivals, watch for us, I'm gonna go blog now" and a big wet kiss for craft brewing and the folks who love it. Then Mike got his laptop from the car so we could get some shots of me typing away, and...well, I promised I'd blog about it, so I'm blogging. And the show...will be on air soon. More about that shortly. Cheers!

From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala has lived in the terror of civil war. The 36-year conflict has produced: 150.000 killed, 50.000 disappeared, 1.000000 refugees, 200.000 orphans, 40.000 widows, hundreds of villages destroyed.

There is this website, who offer support for people with the condition or concerned about it. It has information about the infection and the test and treatment. It dispels a LOAD of myths with facts like GBS is not a sexually transmitted disease and a mother or father can carry it rather happily without ever knowing or ever being treated for it so it is completely innocently passed on to the baby. Simply giving the mother antibiotics in labour can stop the illness from being passed to the baby being born.

For our first grocery trip since getting back, I wasn’t tempted while walking past the meat. When I saw the bacon next to the eggs, instead of thinking yumm, I thought about the slaughterhouse worker who beat the squealing pig, cut its snout off, and rubbed salt on it because he was angry. When walking past the rotisserie chickens I thought about the hormones injected in them and the overcrowded cages they live in and how their beaks are cut off.

Because Africa as a whole has dealt with 50 years of banging its head against a brick wall. Same as in my Mum's Ireland where post-liberation Irish voted in extremism to have the Catholic Church rule the Irish state and to cut off their nose to spite their face. By refusing to do business there 500 year oppressive Colonisers, the Brits. While understandable, led to 70 YEARS OF HARDSHIP. Of Irish being forced to leave Ireland to move to Britain. Same story as Africa. And same story as to why African immigrants into South Africa vote against the new extremist ANC, who've forgotten the Freedom Charter.
Elli is a little skeptical of Shea, but he knows that they were meant to be together, and he needed her in his life. But Elli just doesn’t understand what Shea could see in her. She is overweight, loud, and not even that pretty, so why would someone so gorgeous and so amazing want to be with her? It seemed that no matter how hard she tried to shake Shea off, he wasn’t going anywhere, and for the first time Elli didn’t feel alone.
Update: Tags added.
Easter is a vision of what your church can become. Our former Sr. Pastor, Gary York, used to say, "if you can hit it, you can average it". I think that's true. If people will come to church on Easter, then you just have to figure out what might minister to that group the other 51 weeks of the year. I have prayed this morning that God would grow us into the church we saw yesterday. It is also a great way to assess possible limitations, programmatic challenges, staffing/volunteer needs/parking etc.... If God would make yesterday's service a normal Sunday what would you have to do grow into for that to happen?

When my oldest was 3, I told a group of older homeschooling moms that we were going to have a CM homeschool. They laughed at me! They told me I'd soon give it up because it would be too hard, primarily because at the time there was not a curriculum available (or at least not well known) that used CM's methods. *Now* we run into a different problem--there are so many choices that it becomes confusing. What *is* a CM education?

http://www.hulu.com/tiger-and-bunny Tiger & Bunny is a new show that is being simulcast on Hulu - aka subtitled and available for streaming just hours after it airs in Japan. This show is amazing! It takes place in a future city where super heroes are part of a super popular reality TV series and earn points for the things they do, while being sponsored by major companies. The animation is stunning, the pace is fast, and I am ready to order the toys. I think fans of western comics could really appreciate this show even if they don't like anime.
I struggled, but I finished. ‘Luctor et emergo,’ goes our national motto (I struggle and emerge). I started sending the manuscript around. I was lucky to be introduced to a number of fine agents by fellow writers. Every single one of them wrote me back a personal letter, as did some agents to whom I sent it to unsolicited. Thank you to them all! But alas, no bidding war emerged.

The bourbon boys should not switch between that and beers. Nor should anyone be permitted to ‘upsize’ outside of their shout. You can’t be buying pots for your mates and then decide “I might just have a quick Flaming Lamborghini, actually” when someone else is buying. The Shout works because you don’t even need to ask what the others want, just a quick nod and a point to indicate that you are ’up’. You may sit out of a particular round of The Shout without bringing social disrepute upon your family name – as long as you don’t sit out your shout. The other exception to The Shout guidelines is that it is perfectly reasonable and permissible to exclude any member who wants to drink Pimms, Pernod, Campari or Vodka Cruisers. Unless they are girls. They can drink poofy drinks, but not in The Shout.
Does this mean that dental x rays cause cancer? No. This study was looking at an association, not cause and effect, relationship between reported dental x rays and a certain type of non-malignant brain tumor. It merely brings up the possibility that the two could be linked and encourages caution in minimizing radiation.

Put the chicken in a large pot and add the stock. If the liquid doesn't quite cover the bird, top it up with water from the kettle. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered. Cook gently for 40-ish minutes (I like my chicken slow-cooked and tender, but be careful: if you let it go too long it will become stringy and mealy. Yuck). Remove the chicken from the pot to a platter.
Olivia got in the shower and turned it on. The water was a bit cold but boy did it sure feel refreshing. She stood there for a couple of minutes and let the water just run over her body, the drops running off her long black hair and down her back. Oh, did it feel good.
There undoubtedly was some element of chauvinism in the works of Marx and Engels, which was inevitable in the times that they were writing. It is also true that Marx and Engels themselves concluded that they had overstated the revolutionary potential of the times. In fact, as they were later to state, in 1848, Britain was the only country where capitalism was dominant, and, as they believed that socialism was impossible without capitalism first developing and socialising the productive forces, a socialist revolution was clearly impossible in 1848.

Does this mean we are on a terrifying downward spiral, into an abyss of accelerating degeneracy and dysfunction, with no end in sight? No it does not. What it means is that the boundaries are being pushed to ever increasing levels of insanity, until a cosmic global reaction takes place. Portions of this are taking place at this very moment. That portion of the awakening populations are pushing back and will soon be joined by a much larger mass of their fellows, as conditions make their lives more and more unlivable and more and more dire. It is a matter of time and we are in that time frame.
So it seems that Conservatives, in comparison, just don't care. About people. Or maybe we do. After all, who says that caring about society, or people in society, means interfering with them? Is it intention that counts? or the results?

When The Boy woke up he was REALLY hot. I never take a temperature on a kid unless it lasts more than a day, or they are so hot they can’t move. I just give them something for it. So now, I am in the house with a hot kid and a smelly dog. I REALLY am starting to wonder if having the perfect bunny is going to make up for this. I’m a mess. I can’t even decide what I want for dinner.

Light the color of oyster shells seeped into the small cell, the eastern light of a Vietnamese dawn hitting the slopes of the Dãy Trường Sơn. Rainer stopped, eggshell in hand, watching the little window grow brighter. The hot plate at the end of the counter hissed softly. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the pale blue gas ring capering like a small spirit under the battered aluminum tea kettle perched on the burner. Spirits. Ghosts. He struggled to recall what the natives called them. Ma? Bong ma? The words slipped away like fish in the river.

Next time you are in Church or driving in the car or walking in the mall and your mind starts to wandering and people watching; Stop and think. We do believe in Jesus who was scarred by a crown of thorns and pierced for us – Jesus loves us just as much as He loves them. By His wounds, all prejudice, judgment, narrow-mindedness and intolerance are gone. His Peace was given to us through His punishment. We are all held in His arms – including the different strokes for different folks. When we call out to Him, the original “pierced” Son, heals us – all.

Staley’s behaviour subsequently deteriorated and he exhibited psychotic, bizarre and on occasions, hostile behaviour. He also reported hallucinations, paralysis and exhibited delusional thinking. Staley was hospitalised ten times in total and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and anti-social personality type. During this period, Staley also suffered from depression and was placed on suicide precautions. Staley was most recently hospitalised for approximately 19 months from November 28, 2002 to June 17, 2004.

My icing is something that needs to be improved upon - but I basically strived to make a bone shape in each arm and leg - an anchor like piping for the ribs, and then the skull. My icing could have used a bit more sugar to thicken as it spread a bit after I piped it - but I got the hang of icing after a while. The first few were really creepy looking - but hey - they are for Halloween!
Aside from that, there’s the whole ebooks thing which will hopefully be a positive game-changer for libraries, rather than a reason to no longer have them. We’re hoping to start providing ebooks in my school next year through Overdrive, and it would be great to make some connections with other librarians, and find out what ebooks models they think will work in the long term.

I do not know the name of the film, but I have seen it in a collection of shorts called Wholphin. I'd watch these with my mother because we're both into odd and short. This is a part of one of those films. It doesn't start with the beginning, so I'm not sure what we've missed, but with these kind of things, you can pretty much pick up at any point and have the same level of understanding/confusion.
The tracker rolled over and pushed his dead companion away in disgust. Most of the man’s head was missing. Brains and blood had spattered everywhere. The second of the two deserters was writhing in pain a few feet away. A quick look revealed that a chunk of his skull and jaw were missing. In the tracker’s opinion, the man didn’t have long. In the mean time … he could provide a necessary diversion.

So next time those seemingly vacant eyes roll over you, consider them. Look back with intent. Just stare at one eye, it’s impossible to look into both. And, when you see what looks like your reflection in that unflinching iris, remember that it’s not. It is what you look like in the mind’s eye of that goat. I don’t think there is reason for alarm, but I don’t think it wants to be your friend, either. It’s just a goat, putting off its tomorrows.

In the poetry world longevity and a lasting contribution are always paramount. What we think now fades: tastes and expectations change; very often what is thought fifty, even one hundred, years henceforth (very often by critics and harvardisers, as Harry Clifton, newly appointed Irish Professor of Poetry coined it) is what fixes one writer above another; or conversely what resurrects a writer from ignominy. The view becomes more complete the further you stand away. Perhaps, in part, this may be one reason why the latest addition to the family tree of Irish modern anthologies is an edition from abroad.

Recently however I received this mailing:
Titanic’s story was told by the survivors who witnessed the tragedy first hand on a cold mid April night as they sat in the lifeboats hoping against hopes while they were forced to watch the lost of their loved ones. Every survivor who was on the lifeboat lost someone they loved. The stories conflicted from one survivor to another. Some witnesses said that the Titanic split into two before she went down while others said that it was intact as it vanished. But most of them told a familiar tale of the cries of all those dying men and women in the sea. As time passed by, the cries became faint and finally there was no sound left but complete silence.
Garnish with cheese and I used almond slivers for my portion and the roasted squash seeds for husband's plate. (The roasted squash seeds though nice to eat on their own, did not go well with the risotto). The reason for all the fuss is because we do not like pine nuts too much.

Warning of diplomatic consequences, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the attacks, the first since Parliament’s unanimous vote this month approving new guidelines for the country’s relationship with the United States. Some politicians said the drone strikes might set back already difficult negotiations over the reopening of vital NATO supply routes to Afghanistan that Pakistan blocked five months ago.

Not that. But it is something I'm trying to feel satisfied about, something I want to let be an ending in the best narrative sense of the world. This blog was an important part of a narrative for me. It was the first blog I ever paid real serious attention to. It informed so very many of my opinions while I was a grad student. On things like this and this and this, just to name a few. It was through this blog that I met my first ever internet people in real life. And hey, remember when we did this? Ah, the times.
Something that I’ve toyed at while editing photographs is adding in some color to an otherwise black and white picture. I like the idea of someone’s eyes being drawn to a splash of color in a picture full of grey, black and white. It’s also not really hard to do lol which is a bonus. But I also believe that maybe it can be just a gimmick that helps people turn a boring picture into something a bit more artsy, as I did with this picture of the motercyle.
MASS DEATH IS “GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT”
That's what he said. I was disappointed because I knew the power of this observation in the hands of countless blinkered theologians; its power to back up fundamentally stupid dogma of all sorts when they didn't have a clue what he was on about – rather like me at that time anyway. Not a blind clue that Einstein's vision of God wasn't that of a puppet-master but something vaster than the universe itself, which at least we now know isn't anything like what we can imagine. Much larger even than space, time, nothingness and any
Thank you for sending me The List by Joe Konrath. I liked the set-up for this novel a great deal--a detective investigation a murder finds that the victim shares the same enigmatic tattoo that he possesses. Unfortunately, I just didn't think the rest of the novel could sustain that sense of eerie anticipation. The reason for the tattoos, that all participants were part of a secret government cloning experiment, just seemed a little too familiar, and the constant joking, while witty at times, also eroded the tension and sense of menace. I appreciate the look and hope another editor feels differently. Bantam Dell Publishing Group

The workshop will be a 'Field to Studio' based class. We'll spend about two days in the field making preparatory studies and taking photos, and then take all of that information back into the studio,for three days, to design and work up larger paintings. During the week I will demonstrate my entire process for using the studies from Nature to create a more complex, considered and larger painting in the studio. I encourage you to bring along a laptop and camera to view any reference sources to use in addition to your field studies. The link to the school below will take you to a page of workshop information. You can scroll down to see the description and registration information for my class. I'd love to work with you there if you think it's something that would be of interest.

Parents fight many personal and emotional demons when raising a child on the spectrum. Simply saying “Well, just do this and just do that” is easier said than done. It’s good to understand that each person always does their very best with what they know and what resources are available to them. Offer help before you offer judgement.

Due to personal 'Life Stuff,' we have decided to relieve ourselves of the pressure of posting every Friday. We are giving ourselves the freedom to post on an 'ad hoc' basis until such time as life decides to be a little more co-operative. We do plan to put postings up, but they will be random. For new readers, there's a years worth of material to check out on this blog - (links are in the left hand column) - with some interesting round the table discussions to keep you entertained between any new postings that we manage to cobble together before normal service is resumed.

I can’t say everything went as it should have. The list of events that didn’t go as planned were noteworthy to say the least, but here is a brief overview: In Nainital a massage was interrupted by a man claiming to be my husband, in Delhi my friend lost consciousnesses in the middle of a busy market, another friend experienced a severe case of culture shock, the driver who took us to Agra was 40 minutes late and we missed two important sights, we endured rickshaw wars in Amristar and got ripped off buying shawls, loved Holi in Chandigarh while my Carol’s hair turned a permanent shade of pink and Annette suffered with a two day migraine, in Udaipur we never got our second car but still marveled at the calm lakes and marble palaces, and then Mumbai club life didn’t live up to our expectations and the driver wasted our morning trying to take us to expensive shops so he could get commission.

Update: 4/21 8:03 a.m. (Three days later…) Slow fermentation != Weak fermentation. I do not normally ferment this cold, so I guess I should expect it to behave differently than I am used to. Normally — at 67 °F, say — I would expect fermentation to be mostly done by now. Instead, I check it this morning and the trub is swirling like mad, the kreusen has filled the head space and the airlock, and the fermenter is sitting in a puddle of stale beer. I sanitized my blowoff tube and slowly removed the airlock. It hissed like mad for quite a little bit of time. I am guessing it was almost ready to blow. I cleaned it up this morning and it is happily blubbing away in the blowoff bottle.

Hello friends
I calmly responded to my mother as if she were an unreasonable child throwing a temper tantrum, letting her know that this is what I had to do since she wouldn’t be honest with me. I could smell the wine on her breath over the phone, nearly 1,000 miles away and dismissed her ridiculously slurred speech by repeating to her that I needed to find out the truth. She slammed the phone down and hung up, as expected, and I preceded to go on with my day…. But first……

Patrick and I miss donating time to charities that are important to us. Yes, you can give money to thousands of good causes down here. However, as a cruiser you never get a chance to teach English at the orphanage every week and build up a relationship with the kids, or spend months helping to build houses, or even muck out the cages at the local dog pound once a week. If you are truly cruising, you are moving every few weeks. People who are living on a boat, staying in one place can do those things, but they aren't cruising. We miss making a meaningful committment to a good cause.

Green Lantern #9 (DC Comics) This cover is notable for having almost nothing at all to do with the actual contents of comic beneath it, save for the fact that all three of the characters pictured do a appear within it (although Black Hand, whose giant head dominates most of the cover and whose MADNESS Green Lantern is DROWNING IN, only briefly cameos).

This recipe is fairly easy and sure to impress. Make the bbq sauce the night before and let your chicken marinade in it. Save some of the sauce to brush on while you’re at the grill. The sweet and tangy flavour of the peach screams “It’s summer time!” I have made this for a nice dinner at home, and I’ve also brought it to barbeque at a park for a family picnic. It’s really not that difficult, and people seem to be impressed when I tell them I made the bbq sauce myself.

After the goal, Villa’s tails were up, while we allowed our heads to drop. Our front two looked off the pace and were isolated as our midfield dropped even deeper. Forwards and midfielders seemed to be on different wavelengths, with runs poorly timed or non-existent. Our wing play became less effective, our passing got worse and we were reduced to aimless punts that rarely found their target. For all that though we nearly got back on terms near half time when a good cross from Etherington was headed just over by Jon Walters.

The Beginning: The idea of Fountainhead Brewing started in early 2009. At the time, Michael Ojo was still early in his homebrewing experience and had ideas of starting a business. Over time he came to realize that opening a brewery was truly an extension of his pre-existing passion for food and beverage. "My good friend and I tossed around the idea of opening a brewery and from that idea grew Fountainhead. The original idea was to start a nanobrewery, but over time the idea and plans have grown to what will someday be a small-scale microbrewery," he explained.
On whatever the day,

1984 twisted my thoughts; it got me thinking how far I will go for self-preservation, for loyalty, for freedom. Dystopia lovers (like me) out there will surely squeal in delight upon reading 1984. Oh, yes. Hopelessness is at the very core of it. Remember: Big Brother is watching you. *evil grin*

The particle, until now, has existed only in theory — rigorous theory, first proposed by the English physicist Peter Higgs 40 years ago, but until now it’s never actually been detected. The Large Hadron Collider, the giant particle accelerator 17 miles in circumference, was built deep beneath the mountains on the French-Swiss border to send atoms crashing into each other at nearly the speed of light. It would be enough that if the particle actually exists, the LHC’s detectors would see evidence.

In the postmodern relativist and secular context in which marriage appears increasingly to mean whatever one wants it to mean, today we celebrate what Christians have done for 2000 years and man has done for millennia: the union of a man and a woman. Not just any man, of course: Prince William’s royal lineage can be traced all the way back to King Alfred the Great. When he kneels at the 1000-year-old altar of Westminster Abbey, he does so as the representative of a British institution as ancient as the Church itself, under whose aegis he is joined in holy matrimony. This is not a fairytale: Prince William and Catherine Middleton do not enter the institution of marriage unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly; but reverently, discreetly, soberly, and in the fear of God.

Mystics may be drawn inward, but the oneness of the divine also embraces the outer world. When the eye of the heart is open all of creation reveals its divine nature; everything is seen as an expression, a manifestation of the One Being. Mystics are also involved in the demands of everyday life. One of Christianity’s most loved mystics, St. Teresa of Avila, worked tirelessly founding nunneries and looking after her nuns, while at the same time mystical prayer took her into ever deepening states of inner absorption, oneness and ecstasy. Mysticism does not mean to retire from life, but to live the unitive life. “God,” St. Teresa would say, “lives also among the pots and pans.”

Ultimately, Max Payne works because it's a perfectly-executed action game with a thoroughly-developed central character and a knowing black humour about its own nature (without ever disappearing up its own posterior). Where the game falters is towards its end, when the thematic and character arcs are not brought to as satisfying a resolution as the revenge plot. Payne achieves some of his objectives, but is still left as a battered, traumatised person. It falls to Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne to provide the resolution for Payne's character that is required.

She and her cohorts put us through every imaginable craft and life-skills activity you can imagine. If you could make it out of paper, popcicle sticks, yarn, glue, wax, soap, or mud - we made it! Our troop fluxuated from 26 to 10 or so... This woman lead whoever would follow through camping, horseback riding, crossing swinging bridges (this was a re-occuring trial of note), thunderstorms, camp fires, haunted houses, parades, community performances, and volunteering. Oh man, did we volunteer.
I have been following a young fashion blogger now for a few weeks. Her blog is called Surely Sonsy, and I just love her self-assured style.

She certainly is sonsy!

What happened to women? Women are like moons that can have a sort of gravitational pull on everything around them, but now it is like they are planets spinning off from their orbits, non-directional and ineffective. One thing is women do not like other women, they are competitive and suspicious. I realize some women do have close relationships and that is good but most do not. I am Eve, mother of every single living, breathing person on this planet, and I don’t have close female friends, I want them, but somehow it just does not happen, I have acquaintances, but that is not the same.
The world we live in is a very dynamic place. Situations change momentarily; there is unpredictability and we constantly have to adapt to these.

Last night it was raining cats and dogs so I decided for supper a pot of warm, hearty soup was in order. I ended up trying out this new recipe for roasted asparagus soup and bringing it over to Mr. S.'s house where we opted against subjecting ourselves to Mother Nature's wrath ( I'm pretty sure the barrage of thunder and lightening were the deciding factor) and instead enjoy a night in watching movies with this furry beast...our favorite little third wheel. I mean, how can you resist this cute face?

But there was no hope of concentrating on the books or their titles. She was outraged and tired and feeling completely lonesome and helpless. All she really wanted was to go to sleep but she was still too wound up from the day’s events.
Arriving at an odd hour, in a lull between lunch and the evening crowds, there were plenty of seats to choose from at the scrubbed pine tables. Drei Bier, bitte. Three Spezial Lagerbiers. €2.30 each. Lovely soft carbonation, light caramel and raisins and a waft of sweet smoke on the back. That does the job. Food. Kassler with a rather strong Sauerkraut and bread. Spot on. Spezial Märzen please. Plummy, more raisins, a nice toasty edge under the soft rauch notes. Nicer than the bottled version. Far too easy to drink. Spezial Ungespundetes, the only unsmoked beer they make? Remarkably fruity aroma, like a mix of bubblegum and pear drops. Comes across in the flavour too, like liquidised candy. Not so sure if I like it, but it's hard to follow the smoked beers. If you're there, and it's on, go for this first. Spezial is a nice place, and it seems we spent a couple of hours here, shooting the breeze, catching up and sipping delicious beer. But I bet it's a lot better in the evening with a full crowd.

This is also time-consuming as hell. As with any at home regimen you have to be dedicated. The shortest workout night we have is an hour. The longest is 1 1/2 hours. Every. Night.

Ambition also has these traits: it too is more external than internal. Unlike physical desires, which are satisfied simply by consumption, ambition requires the consensus of others. The honor-seeker, for example, has to be honored by as many people as possible in order to be satisfied.

One of the great pleasures of this writing life of mine has been meeting writers from all over the world who I would never have met before. Often, this happens via the blog. But recently, I met a very talented actor in London, Jonathan Chambers, and he told me about his mother, Diana McCaulay. Diana is from Jamaica and she has written a novel, Dog-Heart, which portrays the realities of life on the streets of Kingston and the seemingly uncrossable gulf between the classes. This is a novel with grit, humour, heart and pathos. It is both heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time, and beautifully written. But this is not for the faint of heart. To be honest, the cover made me think this was a story for the Young Adult category. Although adolescents would gain a lot from reading it, this is very much an adult tale.
And that's why I need your help. I need your recommendations for medium-to-short, highly readable fictions that are still rich enough in ideas, characterization, and writing style to be worth the time.
If I sound like I’m being overly harsh on a show that never marketed itself as being anything other than a primetime soap, I make no apologies. There are far better shows out there playing that game. What made Ringer infuriating was its insistence on insulting its audience with in-episode flashbacks, and characters so stupid it made it seem like the entirety of Lower Manhattan was experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning (if one more person, apropos of nothing, reminds Bridget of things Siobhan regularly does or doesn’t do I’ll kill her myself). If you’re going to earn yourself a reputation as a place where crazy plots reside, at least commit to the bit – have those bitches meet in episode seven, do a game-change in a mid-season finale, and dispatch one or more of the leads in the finale. Don’t whimper over the finish line by coasting on a mystery that you insist on not solving.
In the meantime, I will leave you with the recipe for passion fruit tart. You can omit the joconde and raspberry jelly, and just made a passionfruit tart, maybe with some raspberries on top. Have a happy Summer!
For a long time, I associated getting older with the loss of things. From hair to sanity, grandparents to friends, it always seemed I was more likely to lose rather than gain things after a certain age.

Like I mentioned, we made our wipes out of my hubby's old t-shirts. It felt good to repurpose those dingy whites that would have otherwise gone to waste, but you can use other fabrics you have lying around (maybe some old flannel sheets would be nice and soft on that baby's tush). We use straight water for our wipes solution which we keep in a little squeeze bottle next to the changing pad (we wet each wipe just before using because if you pre-wet your wipes you have such a short window of time before you'd need to start worrying about bacteria growth)...we tried using some other homemade solutions (that involved combinations of water, baby soap, olive oil, and/or tea tree oil), but after some more online research and our own trial and error, we found that straight up water was the least harsh on Little J's sensitive bum.

“Over the last decade there has been a significant growth in interest in aspects of people’s experience with technologies under headings such as user experience, aesthetics, affect, fun, reflection, and enjoyment. In more recent years critical theory has begun to make a small but important impact at CHI conferences and other HCI publications. It is arguable that a relationship between critical theory and experience would benefit HCI research and practice as it has benefited other areas of research in the humanities and social sciences. However, in the history of ideas experience and critical theory have not always made good bedfellows, sometimes complementing each other, sometimes resisting each other. This workshop will explore the ways in which HCI might benefit from a constructive dialogue between critical theory and experience in questions of design and evaluation.”
Again 90% Mauzac and 10% Chardonnay. Also vinified and aged in oak. Somehow the oak accentuates the difference between the Mauzac and the Crémant, giving more vinosity to the wine. Mauzac is quite a rustic unrefined grape and the oak enhances that character but in an appealing way. The nose was quite rich and rounded, with a full-bodied rich herbal palate and some soft acidity. Nicely satisfying and very intriguing. M. Delmas explained that his father used to ferment all his wine in wood, and that the practice has been somewhat lost. Eventually he would like to build up some vins de reserve, so that he can include some oaked wine in all his cuvées, but that is a long term project.

Some warlords will have returned and reverted to past practises. Freedom of the press will be limited. Human rights issues will have taken a backward step, with many Taliban values regaining their 1990s levels of prominence. The Taliban will continue to be a significant presence in the region, militarily and, increasingly, politically. The definition of “Taliban” will remain as difficult to pin down in 2018 as it is in 2008 and may involve some pro-Taliban groups in parliament and other groups resisting by force of arms.

It is called peripheral blood stem cell donation and if I had any medical know how, I would probably put it in better terms.
I have had a deep thought percolating in my mind of late. I thought I would share it. It is along the same lines as the idea that "life is more about the journey than the destination." I have been realizing that life is less about what the beauty and wonder of our creations here on earth and more about us learning to become creators.

Now I understand what the pastor was TRYING to do, but my mind immediately went to the historical implications of that question. Let’s see, what comes to mind when I think of a burning cross? Let me think…
Black currant leaves are most delicately scented in the spring and then is the time to use them for flavouring sweets and all kinds of puddings.This is my own special recipe: Boil 1lb. of white sugar with 1/2 pint water and a cupful of young blackcurrant leaves. Boil without stirring, for 15 minutes; then strain and pour the hot syrup very gently on to 2 beaten egg whites. Beat all the time, till the mixture begins to thicken; then stir in the juice of a lemon and a gill of whipped cream.

Now that I don’t really have to go to QC anymore, it’s difficult to find a reason to go to SM North especially since I’ve cured myself of my compulsive shopping habit and all SM malls are almost the same. Still, sometimes walking around a different mall is refreshing.
Not only that, but today I clobbered through notebook number four for the book. Granted, these are used notebooks, some with only forty sheets in them, but that’s still just about five hundred pages penned if you consider each side a page. With each page around two-hundred-fifty words, that’s 125,000 words!
Now, I have to admit that I don't like the name: Zoomers. Yes, there's just the teensiest bit of jealous territorialism about the Boomer identity. But it also makes me think of zooming around in scooters. It reminds me strongly of the Zimmer frame which is another word for those metal walkers without wheels. And it makes me think of time zooming along. Which it certainly does.
“Only Cheyenne,” I said; then it came to me. Cheyenne has a thing for Josh! “Well, I’ll be damned! My girl’s got it bad for another guy!” I set Jade down off my lap and walked in the yard to kick a few rocks and basically act like a fool, cussing and kicking, before going back to the porch.
I am back home now. I have apologised. The re-writes are done – at least until the next lot. I will try to remember that like a good story, life is full of ups and downs – and of beginnings and endings.
As I cook the risotto, I will add the veg paste and maybe a drop or two of cream. The remainder of the cooked veg will go into the risotto when it is almost finished. Some Parmesan Romano on top, salt and pepper and it's done. Maybe some grated lemon, also.

So what led to the fracas at around 3.20pm?
We went to visit the sweet, sweet school where I taught 1st grade for a few years to say "hello" to friends. Afterward, we went shopping in our favorite outdoor mall.
Of course, it was painful, but my legs held up for the most part. My left calf got a pretty big cramp in it for a long time, but nothing I wasn’t able to run through. I walk/jogged intermittently from miles 10-12, but once I saw 12, I knew I was in the home stretch. Then my running playlist somehow switched to the entire playlist, so I ended up running to Hillsong in Spanish for awhile. Luckily I ran into my boss’s wife, and we finished really strong together!

Another thing that upsets me is she changes her terms very often. When i got the job she told me i would have at least 20 hours a week guaranteed. Since she goes on vacations frequently i told her that at my other job i was getting more hours and that i was going to quit since she was not paying me when she traveled. I know I am only a part time nanny and she agreed to pay me half of the 20 hrs (10) when she was gone. When I told her i was going to quit she told me she was expecting her second child and that she wanted me to stay. But i feel that if she is so cheap .. is she even going to give me a raise when the second baby is here .. ? Highly doubted. What pushed my buttons was that she asked me to take her, her mom and baby to LAX on Thursday. So i did.. when i dropped them off all she said was Thank you for the ride! I was extremely upset she realized i was upset too but u didn't say anything. How can you work with someone who is that cheap? I mean im not her FREE TAXI! I mean we have to contract and i can quit but i love baby K and i don't know what to do. Can anyone give me helpfull tips. My other MB and their family are famous hollywood producers and they want me to quit and go work for them more hours. I have worked over two years with the other family so im not the problem.. But What should i do? Thanks!

Indeed, a massive contributing factor in Wimbledon FC’s original (and still continuing) problems of place was that swathes of matchgoing southwest London handily ignored them to support other ‘local’ clubs such as Chelsea, Fulham, Arsenal. The Dons were dismissable. And even now, with the Milton Keynes move widely derided and now firmly institutionalized against, Merton council are still seemingly disinterested in the club, who – as they did throughout the ’90s – have to make do playing miles from anything like a ‘spiritual’ home, groundsharing again (though this time as dominant partners) in the relative backwater of Norbiton.
I had these blocks with sayings on them that I had picked up at the thrift store to do something with. I painted them white (it took three coats to cover the sayings up completely). Then, I cut the Bow Ties are Cool (a quote of the doctor's) with the Ariel Black font in SCAL. The tricky part was the doctor. I was originally just going to hot glue a little bow tie on here, but then after playing around with an image of the doctor for a long time, I was able to get a fairly decent vector image to cut in SCAL. It is not perfect, and with the small cut, I think I lost some of the details, but I am happy with how these turned out.
After they had left for their respective homes in North Carolina I happen to run across an article about early television shows. Unfortunately, I ran across it in the waiting room of the Oncology Center at Good Samaritan as I waited for my mother to reemerge from her radiation treatment. I’d love to have that article to reference but I do not. Anyway, to make a long story short: I had a flash-back to my granddaughters visit, the little quibbles which were solved by loving parents, the joy and all the fun they had.
It is never preferable to take an animal’s life in this situation if avoidable. With regard to this bear, every effort had been made to take it humanely. Further complications of its recent aggressive behavior dictated a necessary and immediate action.

Knowing what time it is at any point is crucial in today’s busy world. You may need to know when you have to be to work or school, when an appointment is, or even something as simple as when your favorite television show or ball game is going to be on. There are a variety of options for telling the time such as using a cell phone, a traditional wrist watch, or even a silver pocket watch which is both attractive and useful.
I'm entering this into the following fun challenges:
The new paper is by two economists who were working at the Federal Reserve’s Center for Behavioral Economics and Decisionmaking in Boston at the time they did the research. People at the Fed are very interested in understanding how the default crisis came about. “Most often, the reasons economists put forward are, maybe there was not enough screening for mortgage applicants, or securitization, or other institutional reasons,” says Stephan Meier, who is now at Columbia University. His coauthor, Charles Sprenger, is at Stanford University. ”That’s definitely important, but in the end humans make those repayment decisions. So there must be more psychological factors that explain how people make those decisions to default or not?”

Victorian Elegance Theme Wedding: For anyone craving the romance of a bygone era, a Victorian theme wedding may be right for you. Rich colors and sumptuous lace, roses and cupids are all components that can be incorporated into your wedding decorations. The deep colors (burgundies, reds, mauves, dark blues and purples) and rich fabrics like velvet and lace are all well-suited for a fall or winter wedding. Keeping with the theme would be a high-necked gown with a full, layered skirt, lace-up boots and top hats and tails. Another spin on the Victorian theme would be a Victorian Christmas wedding.

But the peplum is about to have a very big year, even though many of the fashion breathren don’t yet know what a peplum is. This ignorance is not surprising: the first thing that pops up when you Google peplum is a website devoted to films featuring Burt Lancaster and Charlton Heston in togas. “The most under-rated genre in the history of cinema” is how one blogger contentiously describes peplum movies, which also go by the soubriquet of sword-and-sandal movies. Further Googling confirms that both meanings derive from the Greek for tunic.
Back in 2007 when Christine Bakke and I founded Beyond Ex-Gay we discussed how those of us who have been through reparative therapies and ex-gay ministries need an opportunity to put on the record what we did, why we did it, what were the outcomes. So many other people have told our stories for us, but in the act of sharing it for ourselves, we can get more clarity and get a little bit more beyond our often harmful experiences to alter our orientation or gender differences.
Also, I feel I should mention that Psychopaint is ADDICTIVE. Put aside a hefty chunk of time because it’s pretty empowering and exhilarating to feel like you are on your way to becoming the next big thang in the art world. At least that’s how I feel…

NABC’s local connection Logo Designs is busy creating fresh allotments of t-shirts for the holiday season. There’ll be Hoptimus and “These Machines Kill Fascists” tees, and, for the first time, brewery (logo + “I’m for It”) shirts in longsleeve. Finally, another small release of the past summer’s Sportstime 20th anniversary tees (men’s and women’s styles) is coming out. NABC’s t-shirts are okay as stocking stuffers, but work even better when you just wear the damn things.
This seasonal variation has posed a key challenge to river basin planners and agriculturalists alike: how to capture and store the river’s waters for more gradual release. At a more fundamental level, but one that has been beyond the capacities of societies within the basin for the greater part of their history, has been the challenge of how to overcome the (sometimes) disastrous inter-annual variations in flow as well.
“We are fighting not only over that last remaining fragments of rainforest, but the very survival of orangutans.”
I don’t know about perfect pitch, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there is something a bit atypical about the way our brains process sounds. The enjoyment of music is very important to a number of people in our family, which I’m sure has something to do with the temporal lobes. A lot of the music that we enjoy is sung in non-English languages, languages from all corners of the world. I’m not sure how unusual our taste in music is, but there does seem to be a hunger in our family for listening to exotic phonemes. None of us are language savants like the famous British synaesthete Daniel Tammet, but there is a consistent line of descent in our family of bilingual or multi-lingual people. I also seem to have a thing about unusual voices. I choose to have people in my life who have unusual voices and I love to listen to distinctive singing voices of a range of types. For me, singing voices are easily categorized as interesting or not interesting, and I much prefer the former. The gravel-voiced rap singers Everlast and Tone Loc have interesting voices, and so do all counter-tenors. I recently read an interesting observation about the extraordinary sound of the counter-tenor voice in a newspaper interview article about German counter-tenor Andreas Scholl. “I think these days the audience knows what a countertenor is, but it’s that inability to readily categorise the voice that makes for better communication – you listen with fresh ears, and focus more on the words.” I believe this is an important element of my enjoyment of the voices of countertenors and other singers with interesting voices. The strangeness of the sound draws attention closely, finely, and it also destroys any set of simple musical expectations. I find strange sounds compelling and interesting, and I’m not sure why I find this so very enjoyable, but I do know from experience that when people enjoy doing anything involving thought, they are most likely utilizing some particular area of cognitive strength.
Melissa drained the noodles, setting the pot back on the range on a new cool burner. She then added the meat sauce to the pasta in the pot. I rinsed out the pan with hot water, which rinsed out very cleanly. My wife and I served ourselves with a side of Broccoli/Cauliflower which we microwaved in a bag. After serving and before eating, I saved the left-over spaghetti, then rinsed out the pot. It also rinsed out very well.

I spent an evening touring the brewery last week, and I have almost too much to report back on. He's brewing tripels, quadrupels, and sour beers ranging from lambic-style fruit beers to red ales (though none use brettanomyces, which Gansberg seems a little spooked about--based on my own experimentations, probably wisely so). Almost all of them are aged in oak for months to over a year, and many are double- or triple-fermented. It's an amazing range for a brewery that produces fewer than 1,500 barrels a year.
The advice I want to give is “Don’t chase it. If it happens, great. Go fight.” But the infantryman wants to be near the gunfire, and I understand that. I understand where they are coming from. I know how I grinned from ear to ear when my Company Commander told our company of paratroopers that we were deploying. I remember the mix of fear and excitement and I wouldn’t give it up for anything.

And I'm interested to read that article about Ponsonby dying. Haven't read it yet but I've really thought that it's starting to look a bit, I dunno, shabby, and not in a #bohochic way. When I take photographs around the city I have to muster the will to get up to the ol' Ponsonby Road. Because, and this is harsh, it reminds me exactly of Hamilton city's main strip. It's really just all about the big city jeeps up there.
All parts of this plant are poisonous except for the fruit. While people say the apple is edible, it is actually bitter (another name for it is wild lemon) and therefore requires quite a lot of sugar to make eating it worthwhile.

The giant wings beat harder, heaving the bird and its cargo upward. The Beast aimed to the side of the nest that overhung the sheer drop, intending to release the load over the deep ravine where it would shatter on the large black rocks far below. It struggled to gain altitude, wavering in the air as if pushed about by a strong gale. The load it carried felt heavy and limp. The Beast shrieked in frustration and pushed the wing muscles harder until they burned with effort.

When we asked her to what extent the Celtic traditions were eradicated she drew upon modern New World history by reminding us of what the Spanish Conquistadors accomplished in Central American.

Another thing that PG boasts is it being the inventor of the common Tea-bag. Legends! Can you imagine where we’d be using loose tea leaves all the time? I’d still be at home brewing it (Urgh I wish) and like many others probably wouldn’t bother too much to make tea. Don’t get me wrong, I love using loose tea and pretending to read the leaves but it’s a lot more washing up and hassle.

In May 1508, signed a contract with Julius II for his masterpiece, the “Sistine Chapel“. The Sistine Chapel (entrance wall, south wall, north wall and cupola) is named after Pope Sixtus (pontiff 1471 – 1484) which made repaint the old “Cappella Magna”. The decoration of the walls includes: the false drapes, the Stories of Moses on the South wall, the Jesus Christ on the North wall and the portraits of Popes on south and north wall. Michelangelo, who travelled continously between Rome, Florence and Carrara (where he personally controlled the marble’s quality for his work) put everything aside and devoted himself to the chapel without interruption, until 1512.

What I'm given to understand is that this particular object of derision (and my eternal anger) is somewhere in a substratum of the debris in his apartment. Until he can produce it, Western is loath-and also not obligated- to apply the credits in a matrix showing what he still needs to take. The problem is that he can be forced, for want of the old *&$@#! Johns Hopkins course catalog, to repeat courses for which he's actually received credit. This will remain an advising, and ultimately, a graduation-related issue until that catalog turns up. I applied a bit of time off and on trying to dig up another copy; I found it right off the bat this morning after not really having a chance to look thoroughly the last couple of days. This is going to require a bit of whining at the JHU archivist. I'm holding off until I hear whether or not his furtive stab at domiciliary archaeology proves fruitful.
Friday evening we worked (mostly Joe as I supervised) in the yard digging a 20 foot trench, 12 inches deep. Sounds like a fun Friday evening right? We have a slight flooding issue (aka Lake English) on one side of the front yard and needed to fix it while the ground was dry. Especially since Sunday's forecast was 2 inches of rainfall. Definitely a good testing ground with the rain and for us to sod the front yard! Woo hoo! More on this during The Lonely Lion Part 4 this week...

The project would provide more than 15,344 construction jobs, as expressed in job-years, but, interestingly enough, the number of jobs would seesaw, in the first phase from as few as 340 jobs in a quarter to 3710 and in the second from 420 to 2215. That would lead to an average of 1500 jobs a year over 10 years, but it suggests that some workers would work only seasonally. (Click on the charts for a better view.)

UPDATE: 27th July, 2010. There has been some discussion about whether the adverse stress tests are sufficiently realistic, for example in the Telegraph and on irisheconomy.ie. The tone of the discussions has tended towards the view that the adverse stress tests were weak and declines in property prices in particular could well exceed the adverse scenario testing. Should the adverse scenario deteriorate then the effect on NAMA would be that the over-payment for loans would be accentuated and NAMA would need a greater improvement in the property market to break even.
My father suggested that I write about the history of Besançon and about the sites here. It's an obvious idea but I just never did it before.

“Relax…I still hunger for you” and with those words she felt the warmth of his tongue find itself against the lining of her pussy. She rolled in ecstasy closing her eyes tightly, her lips forming a smile. The world beneath her gone, she was floating, her body a new tenderness. She took her hands and grabbed his head forcing his tongue deeper inside her pussy. Still smiling, she began to curse, silently at first, then louder and louder until her body jumped and her hips raised, releasing silent requests only Lamar could understand. Orgasms rolled in and out of themselves pulsating about her entire body until she fell back to the Earth they’d forgotten.

The first muslin also indicated that I needed a FBA and more length at the waist, so I did a 1/2" princess FBA, and added another 1/2" of length to the waist.

I mean, I get her point, and I probably have made the same assertion about Jean Rhys (but more, girls should read Jean Rhys, not girls do read Jean Rhys, the difference seems crucial). And I adore Didion - I mean, I am a writer who went to a sport-competitive journalism school, the New Journalists were my literary lifeline. But my early twenties was way more gonzo and tequila than flowers in my fucking hair - I mean, I am and was drawn to Didion because she was a basketcase who made lists of her clothes, also because she's a brilliant, beautiful writer, and yet... Flanagan seems to dismiss Didion the writer and suggest that like Plath Didion is idolized for a persona, one she characterizes as that of the depressive pixie dream girl:

Another glaring time travel problem is why the Borg think stopping first contact is the best plan. Why not go back to prehistoric times and conquer earth then?

Sorry about the photo not being so great. I was fighting with the weather a bit over the weekend. Being new to the group, I have very few Texas related stamps. I'm going to have to come up with some creative ways to use the few I do have until I can purchase more. Since I've been in Christmas card mode lately, I decided to add another to the pile.

For me it is hard to express what a band sets free in me, or why it touches me emotionally. For me music is a way to explore uncharted territory. That's what makes it so magical.
Kenneth Lieberthal, a China expert who was a top aide to president Bill Clinton, said he believed that the United States wanted a solution that is “the least embarrassing to China and to do so as expeditiously as possible.”
Finally, the biggest blast of colour, right now, is the forsythia bush at the front of my home. It has a definite golden glow that suits my sunny mood.

Flavour, says E@L inwardly off on a mental flight to the past, give me some fucking flavour here.
also the day that my tastebuds, well, piss right off. Which, as you can imagine, is utterly screwing delightful. Then Friday – and, for that matter, Saturday – gets worse yet: the tiredness becomes worrying, and to be perfectly honest I’m pretty bloody useless at anything that doesn’t involve moaning or getting dizzy on my way for a piss. But y’know what? I can cope with all that stuff. What I’m struggling to cope with more and more, however, is when the blues kick in. And this time, after a 15% increase in the drugs administered to me, they kicked in a bit more than we’d seen on my first two chemos.

ENERGY: The near coast to coast conservative State governments including NSW, Queensland and Victoria are all rushing to embrace mining and coal and gas exploration and “streamline” environmental protections. It’s like a gold rush – and I believe sand will be the next valuable commodity! With big business, these States are challenging and cancelling many schemes supporting renewable energy and energy efficiency. This must discourage investment at a time when other countries are investing heavily.

Seems like it's been a while since I've posted on here. I've been spending a lot of my time with family members and helping them to work at some serious family issues including my step father's suicide attempt (he attempted to OD on my mom's meds). In addition to those needs, my mother goes to dialysis four times a week in addition to her other weekly doctor appointments so I was running her to those appointments while my step-dad is/was recovering as he's usually "driving Ms. Daisy". As for my step-dad......he is alive and out of the hospital and doing much better now. He was started on Celexa and has been attending therapy sessions. There were apparently a lot of underlying issues that I did not know even existed because he's one of those "I don't need to talk about it" type of guys and my mother never really brought the issues to my attention because she didn't want to bother me about it since she thought he was just "speaking out of his ass" as she kindly put it. My mother then told me of the numerous times that he has threatened to "remove himself from the earth" and yet Mom never took him seriously. She never mentioned any of these things until it came out while he was recovering in the hospital.

Charles has mostly brilliant ideas. That didn’t sound right. I mean it in a kind way, not a sarcastic one. He recommended a visit to the National Geographic Museum. Honestly, I hadn’t even heard of it – how bright is that? Blogless, I grabbed the 18-year-old – let’s just call him Son #2 – by the ear and we made our way there to view Machu Picchu: A Lost City Uncovered, Photographs from the Hiram Bingham Expeditions 1911–1915.
Looks like Kooi, Haag and Zulueta have all they need to move forward. Right? Not if Kooi were the one who walked the feds through on their audit. There’s a disconnect between what federal guidelines are and the findings of the federal audit. Another look is in order.

RYAN: You know, it’s not very evolved, but there’s nothing better than a raincoast crisp topped with Piave, a northern Italian cow’s milk cheese. But, in general, it pairs well with fish, garden vegetables, and Asian flavors… pretty much anything zesty, fresh or spicy.

Oh yeah, our Valentines Dance last night was pretty fun. The kids really enjoyed it. They had GREAT decorations, games that the kids liked, and ice cream sundaes and cookies, that my kids LOVED! We stayed for about an hour, and then came back home. I did get a few pics, but my stupid camera wasn't taking clear pictures. You know, I think I should just go out and buy a cheap one from Wal-mart. At least that way it would fit in my purse, and I'd have it when I needed it. And those take decent pictures. To get a camera that takes FABULOUS pictures, you need to spend more than $150. That's just the cold, hard facts I'm afraid :)

Sunshine, sand, friends, fun, and food. A perfect day. We grilled hamburgers and hotdogs and had a blast. It was just a nice, relaxing day. And the water was COLD, but we were still in it :)
The plan has already been set. I plan on adding SEVERAL people to the group, in case the weak ones die out.
It was the first time the people of Glastonbury heard the tune when she sang it. And it has only been since she died that I've pieced together the timings and can see how the tale she told me links to the WI choral version.
Here are some pictures from my trip to HK. I proudly admit that I take very lousy photos, so don’t be shocked if you spit your noodles out when viewing the charred belly of a trashcan. Many of my close friends (and practically 75% of ACSI- my high school) have exhibited moderate to serious interest in it and I’m so happy because my newsfeed’s perpetually filled with gorgeous images and I don’t even have to forklift my ass off the chair.

One reason is that customers in the US would be confused, they are not used to thinking about beer this way. But the British are used to it, thanks to a large excise tax that is levied on the final alcohol content of the beer itself. Below you can see the current excise rate. Note that lower strength beer (up to 2.8%) is taxed at half the rate, which is why you'll often see breweries brew a low strength beer in the UK so that they can sell it for much less money (I had a great one at Greene King).
Mormon? A religion? The only religions I know of are the Presbyterians, Protestants, and the Catholics. The doctrine fell from the sky in upstate New York? Was the founder an indian? Well, I’ve only ever seen indians up there. I quite like them. They’re the reason I make a mean popcorn.

Yeah, “largely discards the original’s premise.” As if they’re just warning you not to rent this crap! And yes, this is real; the Highlanders are aliens, complete with a plot about what amounts to saving the world from global warming. Are we still in the same universe? How does this have ANYTHING to do with Highlander? And it’s by the same director as the first one?!? Did he just get a surprise back-alley lobotomy in between films? There’s only a three year difference! What the hell happened? Well, I guess we’ll never find out if we just sit around bitching about it all afternoon.

Btw, one of my favorite YA bloggers, the wonderful Diana at 'Stop, Drop and Read' has just left a message in the comments about what she's doing to help. She's giving away free arcs and will donate shipping costs to the Red Cross in Canada so they can send more help to Japan. Here is the link and I hope you all go and visit her.
For me, it makes a great deal of sense to follow Blaising’s lead here and read the cup of God’s wrath in the sense found in Isaiah. The fact that Jesus constantly refers to Isaiah 40-55 is evidence that this is what he has in mind in the garden. In addition, I worry about what it says about Jesus if he was praying to avoid the cross if at all possible. The cross was not just a possibility, it was the whole reason for the incarnation. Jesus would not consider avoiding the cross since he came to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45).
So yesterday, there were a few yard sales going on in my area. I have raised my kids to love yard sales, too. They love finding treasures. We headed to the grocery store first, and then off to yard sales- my first of the season! I spent a total of $7 and check out what I got!

Later, I realized it's probably not a good idea cooking with aspartame so I think I'd look for some soda that has sucralose in it instead or heck, you could probably use real soda since it's only 2 points for an entire can.

But for so long the politicians were blind to all of this. In Bath, one of England’s most beautiful cities, the Liberal Democrat-led council even proposed to erect a 240ft wind turbine on the hills just to the south. The scheme was heavily promoted by a local landowner, the only person who stood to benefit in windfall profits. It was only after mass protests, and a threat by UNESCO to take away the city’s world heritage status, was the proposal reluctantly dropped.
But that’s not really what I set out to write about. What I meant to write about is the life changing power of laughter.
How it all started. Back In the 6th century apparently, a Buddhist monk brought tea to Japan. Jump forward to the 16th century and you have these Portuguese missionary guys introducing tea to the Europeans. The world just hasn’t been the same. I started this series of posts about Tea a few weeks ago and went on a quest to find the Best Tea in the World. Needless to say that is an impossible task however, I’ll tell you what I consider the best if you tell me yours. You can see my recommendation in a minute.
Lindsay looks and acts like the perfect fifteen year-old, but she’s hiding a dirty little secret that no amount of fashionista coverings can make better. Telling her mother her step-father is molesting her is not an option. Trying to kill herself again haunts her more than the scars on her wrists, and pretending to be perfect at school might very well drive her over the edge.
As long as it's filled with tea parties, laughter with good friends and loved ones, sunny days and golden afternoons,we will be sugar sweet happy.

Weird morning! This morning I was walking from the parking lot in my University to my office. Everything was quiet. It as 10 a.m., so students were in their 10 a.m. classes. It was bright and sunny. The sun had finally shown up after weeks of torturous cold. I was walking on the side-walk, telling myself what beautiful day it was. I saw a silver Pontiac approaching. Then something completely out-of-the-blue happened. The driver of the car took his hands off the wheel, stretched out both his hands towards me, sprung out his two middle fingers, and angrily shouted aloud, "fuck you!". It was loud enough that I could hear it from outside, even with the car windows pulled up.
It consists, Ickenham says, of "any good dry champagne, to which is added liqueur brandy, armagnac, kümmel, yellow liqueur, and old stout, to taste." He adds that it's pretty much guaranteed to alleviate the deepest despondency.

Well, as of last night, we were at 1.025, which puts us at 9.2%, if it were to finish up here, but, alas, it is not done fermenting. There is still activity in the airlock, so there's a chance that it'll drop a few more points. If we get close to 1.020, I'll be mighty happy.

Had we known how much fun farm camp would be we could have planned for all three kids to go the same week. As it happened, Maya was initially the only one interested. After hearing about & seeing how much fun she had, Riley & Seth decided they wanted to give it a try. This week was Seth's turn, and he loved it just as much as he thought he would. Maybe more. In a few weeks, Ri will be going to the veterinary-themed camp for the older kids.
Ego never ending. Because they are the shit. Probably successful and very good looking (and not the “yeah he’s cute”! The “oh my God I’d lick your body from head to toe right here right now!” Kind of good looking) Ambitious. A golddigger’s prime target!
Liv is hilarious though. She says the funniest things. Sunday I went into our little bathroom in our room to change and throw on some make-up and she followed me in there, shut the door and said "mama, what da matter?". I looked at her and laughed then said "nothings the matter Liv" and she continued on with "tell me what da matter?". Haha, there was absolutely nothing wrong, but it was so cute and thoughtful that she felt the need to come ask. I don't get to see that side of her every day.
Here I'm... excited to sample the Davidoff Puro D'Oro. The cigar is a new blend whose major characteristic is that all the tobacco is sourced from Dominican Republic, hence the reference to being pure in the name.
I have made a scrapbook page this week for a frame so I thought I would enter it into a couple of challenges. Truly Scruptious #73 (Love and Hearts - as this is a photo of me and my Dad I think the love goes with saying), and Divas by Design #20 (Anything Goes). I have used MME Stella Rose and Kraft paper for the main pieces and just found other bits from the bit box. I covered a piece of cardboard with burlap for the background of the photo, the large heart of course is an inked doily. It was a bit of a dul day when I took the photo so it's not a very good picture, really does look so much much 'for real'

You might recognise one of the Spring Stashbusting Tags that I originally made with some of the littlest scraps from last October's Counterfeit Kit - truly the kit that never dies! I snuck it into my one of my latest counterfeit kits - Country Retreat - because the colours matched so well - and because I already had an idea of how I wanted to use it. Always a bonus!
I found out last summer (last August) that I can still hit a high B (that’s the high(est) note that Anna Netrebko – who is awesome, and probably my favourite opera singer as of last year – hits when she sings Quando Men Vo from La Boheme).
Your goal for LDL levels should be under 100 mg/dL for people with heart disease or diabetes. For people of normal risk, your LDL levels should be between 100 and 129 mg/dL. Anything above 160 ml/dL is considered high and puts you at a higher risk for heart disease.
However, intuition can be a tricky subject. I have dealt with many clients who confuse delusions or illusive tendencies with intuition. This could be misguiding to them, creating anxiety and confusion. The reason for this is that while intuition is something we all have and can access, it needs activation.
Leaving the pity party...
Again, the emphasis here is on Grosvenor being at least upfront and open about these charges and not delivering a whammy after the author submits a manuscript and signs the contract. The package also includes the usual PDF proof, ISBN number (registered to Grosvenor), internet distribution for one year, and also wholesale distribution listing with Bertrams and Gardners. In addition, the author gets five free copies and legal registration.
Her crystalizing and shattering in his arms was actually fairly powerful, and Shu’s normal insufferable whininess actually sounded pained here. So props for this scene, at least.

Busy Busy Busy week (What's new???) Got TONS of stuff done, despite the fact that the spring "SOCIAL" season has begun. Every day brought at least two visitors, which meant stopping for long chats, sometimes over coffee. Oy vay! It's hard to get back into work, but such is life in the Friendly "Hood"!
My challenge for you is to "Use Something You've Been Hoarding." My favorite color is purple, and I've been hanging onto this last piece of Echo Park dsp for some time now, so I decided to just give in and use it :) Another hoarded item is that great piece of mesh I added to this card for a little "beachy" interest. I colored the image with Copics, and paper-pieced the umbrella with matching dsp. The image and sentiment are by SNSS called Ocean Paradise and I die cut it using a SB labels eighteen. The clouds were sponged on using Ranger tumbled glass ink and a hand-made cloud template. I can't help but wish I was sitting in that chair right about now :)
His smug thoughts were interrupted by a rustling sound from behind. He turned to examine the source. Oh, No. Damn Him. Not now. Through a narrow opening in the thicket, a lone figure emerged, his sack of tools tethered to his back with sturdy ropes. He waved a greeting to Sharshar and then went about his business. The intruder, Sharshar had learned, was dubbed ‘Mr. Think’ by the residents of Qabqab. (the name derived from his habit of asking his assistants to always think before acting.) But in his presence he was always addressed as ‘chief’, an affront to his down-to-earth mannerism. He was the youngest son of a well-to-do farmer, and he’d left the village at a young age. Coming back years later with few stories to tell but with plenty of ideas to carry out useful projects, and with the experience and the knowledge to do them well.

Thirdly, as noted by other commentators, several procedural issues remain outstanding despite Tugendhat J's conclusion that the 'case will now proceed to trial in the usual way in accordance with the CPR'. For example, although it seems unlikely that Mr Edwards and Michael Mendahun (named as a defendant because the sex video was available on a website operated by him) would oppose the grant of a permanent injunction, there is no procedure for obtaining a permanent injunction against 'generally described persons' such as the second defendant. In these circumstances, it is suggested that Tulisa would need to obtain a 'contra mundum' ('against the world') order against either Mr Edwards or Mr Mendahun. However, obtaining such an order may not be straightforward as neither Mr Edwards nor Mr Mendahun appears to be threatening further publication of the sex tape.
That news made me so sad.
Love and blessings to all of you my friends!
But I have to say though, in fairness, that this mentality is NOT unique to America. It’s happening all over the world, wherever free enterprise thrives. But you know what, in other places such as the Philippines, their concept of “BIG” is definitely not the same as what’s considered as such here.
A lot of my coworkers are crazy about the thing, but I just can’t stand the thought of yet another giant leap forward in technology so soon after I’m barely comfortable with my Enviro-Sak. I feel like I’m living in one of those rapidly emerging cultures of Asia, where half a generation ago nobody even had a landline phone, and now everyone’s walking the streets with the latest in wireless.
Now Salon reports that major airlines like British Airways, Qantas and Air New Zealand have policies that prohibit unaccompanied children from being seated next to male passengers in the name of child welfare (or more likely, litigation concerns). Personally, I'd just as soon not risk being seated next to a fidgeting germ factory on a long-distance flight to Christchurch, but the implication that having a penis somehow renders me unfit to be seated next to a child is sexist and disgusting.
You will only know what this title refers to if you listened to Randy Travis and country music back in the 80″s. Randy said he was going back to his friends who bought their “coffee beans already ground”….hum the tune if you know it.
Also linking up to Patti at Visible Monday. This outfit may not have seemed so visible, but for me, it was. It was just so different from what I would have worn a few years ago. And isn't that what it's all about?

Then I took my fufu and light soup home and ate it fast while I cooked macaroni because my right hand was starting to swell and I had the feeling I wouldn’t be using it very much come Thursday (I was right) but that my stomach would still be demanding food (right again).
Lastly we have my newly appointed scrapbook desk, which is still under construction and organization efforts...I have not scrapbooked in some 3 or 4 years sadly, nor have I printed the 60,987 pictures on my computer. But, as you can see I am working on that. In theory anyway. Also you will see I painted the bathroom door with chalkboard paint. Good times.

A year later I think it's fair to say that Ruby's transition to a pampered life with a pair of besotted humans has gone smoothly. She remains a quiet girl who rarely barks and only occasionally whines. Moose sometimes supposes this behavior is a result of neglect and isolation in her early life. Poor Ruby never learned she could use her voice to command humans and order her world. That, of course, is one reason we've heard relatively little from her here on the blog. In other respects, though, Ruby is remarkably transformed from the skinny critter she was a year ago. Daily exercise and a better diet have bulked her up considerably. Her paw pads, which were soft as a baby's behind when she arrived in Roxie's World, are now thick with callouses. She enjoys walks, but the concept of play is still something of a mystery to her. Unlike me, she won't hang out in the yard by herself for extended periods of time, chasing squirrels, digging holes, and woofing at anything that moves. In the company of a human, however, she will race from one end of the ridiculously large backyard to the other in crazy figure 8s. Moose is trying to capture this delightful activity on film for the pleasure of my readers. Stay tuned.

New rules: Like I said, a bit of change is nice every once in a while. Here’s the catch, though: I have to be honest with you, I do quite like the current Codex. While that will probably devalue anything I have to say on the matter for many, let’s take a look:

Jan 13 – Shahrizat takes leave from her official duties to make way for the MACC’s probe on whether or not she had any involvement in the NFCorp issue.
That would have been enough to convince me, but to tell you the truth, by that point I was already being won over. Never mind what she looked like – she smelled just like my mother. There are scents that just always stay with you, you know? And for whatever reason I’ve always had a pretty sharp sense of smell. Not that that’s always been a positive thing in some parts of Orgrimmar, let me tell you. Anyway, though…the more time I spent around this woman, the more I noticed it – that smell I can’t really describe but would always recognize when she was close to me, like old parchment and dreaming glories. Like comfort. Like home.
The pretty butterfly is cut at 1.75 x 2.66 distressed and used foam tape for dimension. The frame for the sentiment is cut at 3 3/4 plus the layers and embossed with the divine swirls folder. The sentiment is from K.Andrew Designs ~Positive Thoughts set. Ties it off with a pretty satin double bow:)
I stopped into Roots yesterday to see if I could rustle up either some Epic or the Chocolate Habanero Stout. Epic isn't out til Thursday, but the Habanero's pouring (or burning, depending on your palate). To refresh your memory, last year's version was a fascinating beer. The chocolatey stout was up front, not the chilis. At first, you didn't notice but a touch of spice, but then at swallow, the fire warmed up enough to kindle some sparks going down. It was a subtle background note. Over time, the spiciness would collect at the back of your throat, though, and it would slowly warm up.

The other Pred scrutinized the boy, then declared, “Be that as it may, I can still use this to my advantage. Tupper shall be my talisman against gaudy beasts with ready fangs!”
We must also be mindful that an adjudication of neglect carries long-reaching consequences. This finding may be used against K.H. in subsequent proceedings, including proceedings to remove the children from the home or to terminate her parental rights. A finding of neglect may also carry a personal or social stigma far beyond the limited circumstances involved in this case. Thus, the courts should be very careful about making such a finding merely out of caution.
....or should I say Operation Right Hand! Today (Monday) I am heading into hospital for an operation on my right hand (my dominant one) which involves removing some bone and tying together my thumb and my index finger. It's a bit complicated for me as I don't actually have a lot of index finger on that hand, due to a childhood accident, but I have managed for nearly 60 years to continue to use my dominant hand. Indeed I taught students to type and later to use a computer keyboard and was able to use my lack of a finger as all the more reason why they should be able to achieve good typing skills - if I could, they could!
I look back on this first initial reaction I had when hearing about an Equal Money System for the first time and find it quite fascinating at how I was able to completely, disregard/dismiss this point of having any value what so ever.

Most historians, using their own hands, would never dream of handling anything other than the extreme edges of a document. They certainly wouldn't run their bare fingers along the text. It just feels wrong. The delusion that a glove is something clean breaks down that psychological barrier. Hence the amateur genealogists on telly pointing their way though letters and registers like five-year-olds learning to read.

When one faces death he begins to realise what is truly important and necessary. Earthly possessions really aren’t that important for, as they say, “you can’t take it with you.” There were certain things on that boat they could do without. They were now seeing that those physical things were becoming a hindrance rather than a necessity. That, no doubt, is true with many who are now hearing this message.

John McHugo, chair of Lib Dem Friends of Palestine, says, “This is a witchhunt based on trial by blog. Jenny’s motivation in speaking up for the rights of the oppressed is anger at injustice when others, who have the duty to speak out, pass by silently on the other side of the street. It is also an attempt to make Jenny the story, and to detract attention from the evils of Israel’s occupation.”

The sound from Firpo's recording would have been relatively imperfect, but the image makes me want to know more: where was the studio, how did the musicians get there, what was the weather like?

When he’s brought to the villainous lair (a flimsy room upstairs in a dive bar), he promises the bad guys he’ll kill them if they’ve hurt Kitka. Not, “I’ll bring you to justice, evil doers,” but “I will f*cking rip your heart out of your chests, feed it to the others, then sh*tstomp your faces so hard people will think there’s four f*cking Clayface’s running around.”

Before you seriously begin a real estate investment, make sure you consider the real risks that you would be taking with a venture like that. A new investor is likely to learn the hard way that there are serious downsides to being new to the game. Take time to gain knowledge about real estate investing before you put your money on the line.
Even less accurate is the Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE), sometimes referred to as a Voice Stress Evaluator. Supposedly, during a lie, the voice reaches a higher pitch than when someone is telling the truth. While the PSE does measure variations in emotional stress, that’s not necessarily indicative of deception.

Just when you thought that California couldn't get any crazier they find a way to do just that. Enter Assembly Bill 1960, which enables owners of businesses that contract to the state to identify themselves as LGBT. Please don't ever tell me that the state of California doesn't have their priorities straight as to what is important in the day to day lives of the people living there. I mean, who wouldn't think it's important to tell the government ones sexual orientation? And just why would the state of California require this information anyway? Well, one can only speculate, but my guess is that if a person were to identify with the new elite and untouchable class - the fabulous LGBT peeps - then your business would get a great big green light for the state to do business with. Gone are the days when the business playing field was level and no one was interested who you poked in the dark as long as you got the job done - enter the days where your sexual orientation is more important above all else. Just where is the enough-line drawn with this LGBT crowd? Now that they have successfully lobbied the lobotomised bureaucrats, what's next? Maybe they should push to tattoo the foreheads of everyone who isn't part of the LGBT community? Take their children away? Chase them out of the state? Keep it up California - your state is doing real great! No budget - tick. No money - tick. High debt - tick. Happy LGBT community - tick, tick, tock.
Now, in the 21st century, jewish power and influence increase essentially unchecked. For the last six decades the jews have gone into overdrive, generalizing and adapting elements of their narrative to other "minorities". Slowly but surely this is what has turned European-founded societies inside out and upside down. When jews and other diversities exclaim, "Diversity is our greatest strength", they are exactly right.

Let me first clear up something: there is nothing sexy about your semen. It’s got the texture of Elmer’s glue mixed with the scent of chlorine and sweaty balls. It’s a fucking chlorinated, sweaty ball stew. I don’t care how diligently you’ve studied porn (oh, that was your major in college?), we are not thirsty for your sticky juice. I was lucky enough to discuss this topic with my girlfriends this past weekend and we’ve all agreed, yo’ jizz don’t taste so good. One of my friends did reveal that her ex who ate a lot of fruit (pineapples, strawberries) tasted sweet. The same food items that make our twats taste good have the same benefits for you. However, most of you live on steak, potatoes, french fries, burgers…making your ‘izz taste like ‘ish. But I digress, because we all agreed that we’d much rather suck your dick than lick a pussy. You guys have it rough too. Anyway, girls still swallow sometimes, so what does it mean?

Susie’s cousin Bobby (totally not his name either) is in my class as well. One day when his older sister (a former student of mine) came in to the school to drop Bobby off, one of the other students said to Susie, “Your sister is in the hall.” Susie yelled back at them, ”That’s not my sister! That’s my twin!” Ok, this one needs some description (I really am LOL.) The ”twin” (really her cousin) is about 3 years older, dark complected with long, black hair. Susie is about 2.5 feet tall, very pale, with long blonde hair.

Today was our second class and it was all about Analogous colours. Analagous colours lay beside each other on the colour wheel. Beside turquoise heading towards the greens is first aqua blue. As the fabrics I found in that colour were very close to my turquoise (the colour shift was very subtle), I chose to skip that one move on to the next colour, aqua green and then blue green. Below are the two rows of fabrics I chose in each of those colours.

Although I was on the edge of my seat for Cassia and Ky to find each other, the book as a whole did seem somehow bland. The characters travel around quite a bit and undergo some introspection, but a curious lack of tension and foreboding meant the plot suffers as a result. There’s also a nagging sense of familiarity: if Matched felt like The Giver, Crossed feels like the Obernewtyn series by Isobelle Carmody.
But really, all I want to say out loud is... I'm really proud of me for doing this... sticking with it... and keeping an open mind with some of the foods they want me to eat.

Jews Hate Whites may be an idiot, but his anger is justifiable. And when one contemplates the political imprint of America’s Jews in the last 100 years, from Max Shachtman to Noam Chomsky, from the Jewish Socialist League of America in the 30’s to the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action in the 90s, from Saul Alinsky to the Rosenbergs, from Abbie Hoffman to George Soros, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Ramona Ripston to the current crop of Jewish politicians in Congress and machers in the White House, one begins to worry less about the veracity of the MacDonald hypothesis and more because of the veracity of his facts.

If you haven’t seen the show the little dog, Blue, has this great super power called “Skadoo”. Basically she sings a little jingle and jumps into any picture or book and she’s magically in the scene.

If possible, do this in a separate meeting. When I was at Lakeshore Community Church the leadership often made use of 15 minute quick meetings between services to give teams simple updates. On more weighty issues, like culture change, another venue with no time constraints is better. Answer questions. Be kind. Use “I” statements, and do not ever down the old system. DO explain where the team is going and how the old system is not able to get you there.

The boat trip to the market place was decent, though the birds where a bit out of control. With our loot bags in tow, we spent the better part of the day haggling prices with merchants. Overall, Bransen does make a good haggler, even with his simple ways. While in the market, Jarvyk brought up the topic of help Ashton look for his missing father, another necromancer.

While the SRS is not yet considered a diagnostic instrument, a T-score of 60, one SD above the mean, is currently the SRS-based cut-off for an autistic spectrum diagnosis. Standard scores from 60 to 75 currently indicate SRS-based "mild to moderate" autism; 76 or higher is the SRS-based "severe" autism range.
I always knew that phase was precious in its fleetingness. Once you know a city and develop a routine and relationships, time takes on its regular cadence. Tick tock. Tick tock. The magic and possibility, while still there, aren’t felt as strongly. Soon, they no longer tease and lead you to new sensations and experiences. Only because your heart, curiosity and eyes aren’t open as wide. (Which, I don’t think is tragic, but, rather makes the fleeting stage more beautiful.)
I recommend this book highly. It is well paced and there are some gorgeous passages. I do have some minor reservations: the formatting is not consistent, the proofreading could have been better, and sometimes—but not a lot—the dialogue is stilted. But these quibbles hardly sink what is a fine read.
It's a simple matter, however, to discourage on-the-fly spell trading without arbitrarily forbidding it. All you have to do is make it a long, difficult, expensive and risky process, and it will happen rarely, if at all.
February 14th. A day to celebrate love with flowers, chocolate, romance. Sounds wonderful if you have someone to love, or even the hope of finding your true love, but if you are one of the many bereft whose beloved has died, the day brings not romance but tears. You remember that once you were loved, that once you loved. Of course, you still do love — love doesn’t die — but loving the eternal essence of someone who is dead is not exactly the same thing as loving someone who is present in body and mind and heart and voice.

The heading of this post is the tagline of a wonderful book that I’m reading currently. I was browsing in a bookshop( one of my favorite occupations) when I happened upon this book in the non-fiction section. The title was ‘Leading Ladies’ penned by Sudha Menon. For a moment I stood there, indecisive about picking up the book. When I did pick up the book, I turned a few pages, put it back on the shelf, moved on, then came back, looked at it some more and then on an impulse decide to buy it. And boy, am I glad I bought it.

Yeah. Markers and highlighting in pink ink. They’re all just passages I want to remember… things I found interesting; descriptions of favorite characters; awesome scenes.

Wednesday I celebrated granddaughter Gigi's first birthday with her. Her mommy had bought a mylar balloon for her and we need not have bought other presents.

Little Man is babbling more today. He crawls around saying "ba ba ba". It is so precious (and a little sad, knowing that in 2 short years he will be talking nonstop to the point where I'm begging him to watch a movie so he stops talking). Every mother deserves a little quiet time. :)
My ribs are still a little sore.
Other strategies of treatment consist of freezing and you can get hold of aerosol spray to freeze the warts yourself. Some people report that utilizing duct tape or maybe electric tape can suffocate the hpv warts. You’ll want to hold the duct tape secure continually and remove it only a number of times which usually tends to make this treatment challenging.
Walker’s victory comes with a consequence. He could have had Michelle. He could have ditched his wife and his kids for a fetching young vixen. He chooses his family instead. It is not a decision he will likely ever regret, but he’ll carry the burden of making that decision, always. Michelle’s last words (“Don’t leave me alone”) will be on his mind for the rest of his days. I think this is what Frantic is ultimately about: the choice of love over lust. But I think it also asks something else: can love be found in lust, too?

Dead Heat is the latest novel from Bronwyn Parry and it had been on my radar for a little while. I’d seen some good reviews and I do love a good suspenseful mystery. When I finally got my hands on it by way of my local library, I was definitely not disappointed. Dead Heat opens with a bang with Jo discovering the body of a dead man that, they later discover, has been tortured horribly before finally being shot.
Mark speaks of three apparitions: The first, when He appeared to Mary Magdalene; the second, when He appeared to His two disciples, who went to Emmaus; and the third, when He appeared to His eleven disciples, whom He reproaches for their incredulity.
In an attempt to polish Islam's image, muslim activists usually quote verses from the Koran that were written in the early days of the Islamic movement, while Mohammed lived in Mecca. Those passages make Islam appear loving and harmless because they call for love, peace and patience. Such is a deception. The activists fail to tell gullible people that such verses, though still in the Koran, were nullified, abrogated, rendered void by later passages that incite killing, decapitations, maiming, terrorism and religious intolerance. The latter verses were penned while Mohammed’s headquarters was based in Medina.

In agreement with the Supreme Court ruling on June 3, 1993, Janet Reno ordered the Delta Force and Navy Seals to Switzerland, England, and Israel to recapture trillions of dollars of gold stolen by the Federal Reserve System from the strategic gold reserves. These nations cooperated with the raid because they were promised their debts owed to the United States would be canceled and because the people who stole the money from the United States also stole money from their nations as well.

In another sense, however, Farred’s remarks reveal a mind preconditioned to see racism everywhere, even where it clearly doesn’t exist. This is, after all, a professor who produced a 95-page essay claiming that something that occurs every day in the NBA—a coach complaining about fouls called on his best player—actually showed how the “NBA is once again fraught with the ghostly presence of race, now refracted through the Asian body.” (p. 15)

A good example is the current debate about whether oil companies should receive tax subsidies. President Obama favored cutting off these subsidies because these companies made millions in profits last year. That is, they don’t need the corporate welfare of the state in order to survive in the free market. Republican, on the other hand, argued for continuing the corporate welfare of these companies, advocating an inherently protectionist or interventionist approach to the market. On this issue, the parties switched: Obama supported a free market measure where Republicans advocated a position that was inherently interventionist (and thus in their own parlance, big government). No one has really noted this change whatsoever. It makes sense, however. It’s like 1984, where Republicans advocated Keynsian growth while Democrats advocated for fiscal conservatism. If both parties are dominated by business interests, then it is just a means of revealing the shifting business interests and needs. This is why I think that the liberal-conservative divide is a red herring because it means we don’t notice the ways in which our party system is united.
Finally, in this week (and it's only Tuesday!) of looking back, I am celebrating Joe Polin, a former student, whose beautiful essay was published in the Pennsylvania Gazette last year.

If the person in question must lose some weight, in order to reach her/his healthy weight, it is a healthy option for her/him to choose a long term weight loss program, which causes loss of the body’s fat, while preserving the muscles mass. To obtain this successfully, she/he must control her/his appetite, by eating when he/she is physically hungry, cutting the saturated and hydrogenated fats by 20 to 25% of the total of the intake calories, but not the unsaturated fats; the carbohydrate intake must be cut between 10 to 20% of the total of intake calories, but not more, as it may causes side effects; the proteins must be increased by 1.6gr per each kg of body’s weight.

It was packed to the tiles with mostly long term, mentally ill addicts who'd wash their smack down with Tenants Super and whatever downers or sleepers their stench had forced the local GP to prescribe them. Marge wasn't in the hostel proper but had somehow managed to wrangle one of the permanent flats on its premises. That was kinda like everyone's dream in those days: to get one of the self-sufficient Lime Grove flats. They were the after-junk-life paradise offered up by the God of the Hostel. The only catch was that to get one you had to be either sober or dying, and that's why for there only being five flats up for grabs the hostel was able to 'permanently' rehouse 50 people a year. That its success was based on its rate of eviction no-one seemed to care about. Housing and evicting fifty people were better statistics than housing only five. Anyway, these little apartments sat just below, down where all the hostel residents could see and drool over them. There were no throw out times, no bars on the windows, no sign-in desk. It was freedom for the lucky few; a place to secretly kill yourself in peace. Only for the lucky few who had ascended to Hostel Heaven it wasn't so much a paradise as an open hell: a den of addicts all cohabiting and thieving off each other. As everyone had once dreamt of getting out the hostel now they dreamt the same of this place. Only this was permanent and there were only two ways out, and neither was a very attractive proposition. So it was a dream turned to shit, and this is where Marge lived and where I knocked him up that bright autumn Sunday afternoon.
Boston/City-Year – I spent the bulk of my time at Northeastern University’s International Village dormitory. Although most of my time was spent in workshops or with colleagues – we did get to visit a little. I was able to steal away with a friend of mine one night and visited Harvard’s campus and ate a japanese-fusion place with great outdoor seating and drinks!
Now, the Spouse Sparrow is quite shy and modest, and blushes easily. It's taken quite a lot of totty being thrown at him, and me harping on about it, before he even realized what was up. And now this, with Dr. DeVil, on top of it all.
I feel as though the breath has been knocked out of me and I am gasping, just waiting for it to return.
From the parking area head in SW direction across the slickrock to the rim of the canyon. From there, follow the carins toward the rock ledge and look for a boulder near the edge of the canyon rim- you will enter the canyon by passing between the boulder and the wall of the canyon. The hike is about 1/2 mile round-trip.

Overall, if you don't know anything about being a bike messenger I imagine this book would be illuminating. Even considering all the boring parts and the author's blatant self-absorption, I'm glad to have read it. But as a rabid biker and ex-messenger myself, I expected a broader scope, and a much more detailed look at the issues of biking in today's American cities.

Vern’s days of major chart success were about over by the time Nickels and Dimes and Love was released in March 1993, not surprisingly for an artist 58 years old. Although the hits had largely stopped, the excellent recordings continued in abundance. This album has a little different history behind it than Vern’s other Columbia releases as producer Rick Hall took Vern to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to record this album.

Okay, you can have your laugh for the day over this one. A friend introduced me to Steampunk about a month ago and it intrigued me to the point that I was willing to "take it on" and step out of my box. So I gathered all my fun stuff and started creating this 12 block shadow box (felt more like a 12-step program if you get my drift).

My Thoughts: This book was incredibley intense. Fallon has written a wonderful set of short stories about life on Fort Hood and in Iraq. There are stories from the point of view of army wives and some from the point of view of the men returning. The stories are heart-breaking, horrifying and some leave you feeling like you have just been punched in the stomach. The stories sucked me in and made me feel like I knew these characters. I liked that, even though this was a set of individual stories, some of the characters from one story would make an appearance in another story. It was interesting to see how all these peoples' lives were intertwined and there was a definite sense of family among the people living on the base. I normally am not a fan of short story collections but this is definitely one of the best books I have read this year. 5 stars.
Well, the soup was enjoyed by all. One of many things I'm thankful for. But, what will we have tomorrow?
I saw a link to Air B+B in an Apartment Therapy post back in March. I had never heard of it before, but thought it seemed pretty cool. I’ve been a host with US Servas for several years (an international home stay group), but hardly ever get any visitors. I love being a hostess, and I’ve really enjoyed being a host and a traveler with Servas, so I thought I’d sign up to Air B+B and see what happened. (Another difference is that I pay to be a host with Servas and get no fee from travellers, but with Air B+B, people actually pay to stay in my house — crazy!).

The movie proved that a comic book source material can be treated seriously and without a tongue in cheek attitude towards anything out of the ordinary, resulting in a dark and highly entertaining piece of comic book cinema. The script was respectful to the source material, but added elements such as Kristofferson’s character Whistler, and elements of Blade’s struggle with what he is, that helped to make the story work in a cinematic context. The movie successfully made almost three times it’s budget of $45 million in the world box office, establishing the character enough to spawn two further movies and a tv-series spin-off.
“I then asked what considerations determined her attitude to pictures in general, and she relied with equal sincerity that they were, of course, considerations of aesthetic quality – “composition, colour, harmony, power, what have you.” She honestly believed to be guided by purely aesthetic value-judgements based on those qualities; but if that was the case, since the qualities of the picture had not changed, how could her attitude to it have changed?”

Then, early this summer, the creeping voice became too loud to ignore. It forced me to face facts: I’m a single mom. I’m saddled with student loan debt. I desperately need to devote more time to income-providing activities, not less. I live in a foreign country and have no family to help out. And…I’m only one human.
But even that, as sweet as it sounds, doesn't always deflect the criticisms. When they do come, there are a number of ways a parent can respond. Some parents choose the "fuck you" approach. In practical terms, this often takes the form of "my choices are not up for discussion, and if that doesn't work for you then stay away." That's an okay approach for as far as it gets you, which is often to a place of hurt, conflict, an negativity. I have always resisted this approach, based on something my Dad told me when I was very young: when you wrestle with a pig, the pig has a blast and you just get crap all over yourself. Nothing joyful or productive about that.
You can hear Meigs Creek before you actually get to it, and it's a typically gorgeous little mountain creek. Lots of rocks and little pools, with the banks overhung with rhododendron & hemlock (although sadly many of the hemlocks are dead or dying from the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid infestation). There are no bridges across the creek, and I counted 18 crossings ranging from around 8 feet across to less than 2 feet. But the water was low today and there was no problem rock hopping.

A disappointing training day. With the broken treadmill my highly motivating wife suggested we go to a gym, and we found one in Celebrity Fitness, a chain of gyms with an outlet in Mid Valley Megamall, a 10 minute drive from the house and a building full of distractions for Amanda, Emily and Emily’s Grandpa, who volunteered as chauffeur and local guide.

So what does a "Mother of the Bride" do when it is approximately six months before her daughter's wedding and she is not happy with her appearance? She joins a gym to workout a couple of hours every day and she goes on a low fat diet consisting primarily of vegetables. At least that is what I am doing, and why I was happy to see this recipe for Sweet Potato and Lentil Soup in the December, 2011 issue of the Food Network Magazine. The ingredients of sweet potatoes, carrots, leeks, and red lentils, seasoned with fresh ginger and curry, sounded very appealing to me, and the approximate 257 calories a serving was a definite plus!

Elements of the ending were certainly inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Star Child in 2001 and the godlike boy at the finale of Mass Effect 3 are definitely artistically tied. However, the god child is not the object or result of the game as it is in Kubric's and Clarke's masterpiece. In 2001, the Star Child is the object of David Bowman's surrealistic and abstract journey--the unknown, unseen, and incredibly highly evolved entities evolve Bowman into something more similar to themselves. The protagonist is humanity as a whole and the objective for Clarke and Kubric is to demonstrate our future and our evolution into something greater.

I started off writing some comedy sketches for my theatre company - which mostly involved boys dressed up as girls. I then embarked on a long and complex novel about the first two years I lived in Israel. It was for a slightly older audience than Phoebe and I very naively sort of wrote it and sent it off convinced it would be fought over at some huge auction and then published to critical acclaim!!! In the event one publisher was interested in it and while they held on to it for quite a long time it was eventually turned down. It was a great learning experience but when I think about it now I cringe!

While we certainly affirm the value of leading bible studies, it seems that at the root of this man’s discontent was not wrong activity, but wrong understanding. He (and the conference organisers) had undersold the value of the world. They failed to realise that this man’s primary witness to the world is given as a carpenter. As this man works skilfully with wood, making joints and splitting the pencil line with a saw cut, he calls attention to Christ’s powerful and creative reign. He advertises Christ’s Lordship as he relates to other tradesman in a way that challenges idols of selfishness, sensuality and individualism. And as he works, the words of his mouth and the shape of his life witness to the cross and resurrection.

There are millions of Vietnamese adults living in the U.S., and as American citizens, we all have the vote. If we show the politicians that we are united, they will listen to what we have to say. It does not have to be Barack Obama that we are calling upon. If our voice is strong enough, other candidates will come to us, instead of the other way around. It is not out of the question for Governor Mitt Romney to throw is support behind us if we are willing to reciprocate with our votes.

I originally meant this to be more or less a space dungeon for the characters to crawl around in, and it was, but in the end I mostly focused on combat encounters.

Good thing we had a full group that session.

It's interesting that even though I have been through so much, and I know how suddenly life can change, I can still get caught up in the day to day craziness of life, without realizing that I am failing to stop, and take time to enjoy all of it! So as I come up on this milestone anniversary, I am taking some time to reflect, and take stock of my life now. I am so grateful for my good health. I will re-focus, and make adjustments, where my life is out of balance.

I don't know if it's because I'm older and have more experience, or because of the miscarriages or whatever, but I worry so much. Billy is still completely breastfed, which I'm delighted about as his two older brothers were only fed like this for three short weeks. Billy has five teeth and yet he doesn't show any interest in eating anything solid!! I've tried offering various bits from my plate and he'll have a little taste and then does a dramatic shudder which makes us laugh and lets us know exactly what he thinks of my cooking!! He sleeps very well, usually nodding off around 10pm and not waking till around 5am or sometimes 6am for his feed. And he's growing, growing, growing!! Maybe his little body is putting all it's energy into growing and the toe-touching, rolling and sitting will all come later. Maybe he just plain doesn't WANT to touch his toes!!! It's now that I miss not having a mother figure to turn to. Someone to say, "He's fine, he's beautiful, you're doing a great job. Relax.". When my children have babies of their own, I want to be there for that. So, I just cuddle him lots and lots and everywhere I go, Billy goes too. He LOVED B&Q!! Ok, maybe I exaggerate, but he certainly liked sitting in the sling and watching me humping bags of compost into the trolley. He smiles. He laughs. He's happy. Does anyone else worry as much as I do?
Investors focused on Greece’s fiscal woes for much of the three months. As agreement on a second bailout package for the troubled country grew more certain, market sentiment and share prices focused on the positive. An infusion of liquidity by the European Central Bank also helped stocks, particularly the financials sector, by ensuring that banks would not run out of cash over the near term. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, was among the better performers with its best first quarter since 1998.

As a result of taking down Cecilia, however, Ichika gains yet another girl who takes an interest in him much to Houki’s annoyance since she’s clearly never stopped thinking about him. Then a new transfer student from China arrives, she is Rin Fan who also happens to be a childhood friend since their junior high days. Rin also happens to be in love with Ichika and that fact is obvious from the minute she greets him. However, Rin is rather upset that a totally oblivious Ichika didn’t get the meaning behind a promise he made her a long time ago. As a result, they battle it out using there is when an unidentified rogue IS appears and both Rin and Ichika must work together to stop it.

This is my first entry - I think I am doing two - and she is just Gorjuss!! The background paper is from My Craft Studio Walk in Wonderland, which I printed twice, once with and once without Gorjuss, and cut out the bubble with her on to decoupage.

Pep Guardiola, as Barcelona head coach, won a major trophy every 18 games. Yep, you may have to read that again. A major trophy every 18 games. He created a squad of world-class players that played with one mentality, keep possession. Your opponents can’t score if they don’t have the ball but what if they do? Easy, Pep told his players they had 6 seconds to get the ball back and more often than not, because of high defensive pressure all over the pitch, they would.

Others go further, by providing Web sites with health tips and wellness information or offering online appointment scheduling.

The reason we offer a lower tax rate for investment is that it is good for the economy and society as a whole. Already the tax rate for companies is the highest in the world and the tax rate for investment is the highest in the world so actually we are hurting ourselves when we claim it is not fair for millionaires to pay a lower tax rate. They already paid the higher rate when they actually worked and earned that money now they are only investing it instead of hoarding it like Scrooge McDuck.

The Statue of Liberty stands in Upper New York Bay as an icon to American freedom. Within the context of the United States, for many, New York City stands as a place to chase their dreams and also to exercise freedom to express themselves in any manner they choose without fear of ostracism. Here, New Yorkers are extremely tolerant, even embracing and nurturing eccentricities that elsewhere would be untenable. In the case where behaviors are even technically illegal but benign, laws are often not enforced.

The immediate feelings of immense pleasure go away and the affair has ugly, dangerous ramifications on both Sabina and Jung’s life.

As sushi master, Jiro is virtuoso/maestro and conductor in one - he lives, breaths and dreams about sushi, and how to constantly take it to the next level of perfection. He instructs his team consisting of his eldest son and apprentices as a conductor leads an orchestra - pushing each through endless repetition, with improvements all along the way to be the best at their craft. Directing each to create the perfect experience for their guests, in their 10-seater space, each and every day. Jiro commands the same respect from his diners - no specialty rolls with gimmicky names, dippings or distractions like appetizers are offered here - his pristine sushi is meant to be eaten as soon as it's served, and his unspoken demand of the diner is exacting: focus on your meal. And Japanese food writer Masuhiro Yamamoto describes a meal with Jiro as like a concerto - there is a fluid progression of movements: you start with the classics, and build towards the subtly inventive, inspired cadenza, leading up to a theme with variations for finale. All in under half an hour - because Jiro runs a tight company.

And these commitments are fairly modest. A Judicial Committee meets regularly to handle complaints about people’s behavior, and people are expected to serve turns on the committee and testify as needed. Also, Sudbury students are typically expected to do periodic cleaning chores. School governance is overseen by a weekly meeting that reviews the work of the Judicial Committee and considers proposals regarding rules and activities that could affect the normal flow of the day (e.g., field trips, parties, visitors). Then there are clerks and committees to whom much of the school’s business is delegated, along with certification (aimed at ensuring safe, responsible use of school equipment) and age-mixing (Sudbury schools are open to ages roughly corresponding to grades K-12).

What he needs most is the salvation that comes only through the life, death and resurrection of your Son. Save him, God! Make him run away from sin and crawl to the foot of the cross in realization that he deserves only hell because of his rebellion against you. Then, please, lift his head to see the glorious hope of the Savior’s face. Wrap him in the righteousness of Jesus so that he will live in the atmosphere of your grace all of his days, and bring him home to heaven to live in the blissful perfection that your full presence provides.
I will have approximately two hours each day to do readings. Any further venues in Europe where speaking or consulting may be required, please give me notice.
Laura remained still, in the armchair next to the door, just watching, carefully.
Standing in front of her mirror, April pulls the brush through her shiny, blond hair. She sees her bed behind her, with its Strawberry Shortcake Dolls arranged neatly on the pillow. Still looking in the mirror, she moves until she sees the poster of Big Bird.

This is what Zhang Dali, even with his impartial and straightforward display style, is trying to remind us – that there are two histories, a history of the image and its politics and another history, a true history that becomes difficult to know, only able to be hinted at through reconstructed accounts and speculation. It is almost as though the history of the lie is easier to know that the history of the truth when it comes to images.
Without a Word is Jill Kelly's memoir of her marriage to Jim Kelly, specifically as it was affected by having a severely ill/disabled baby. It came unsolicited, and I decided to give it a try. I knew I'd either like it or it wouldn't wow me. It pretty much wowed me. So I'm almost halfway through. I think I will feature a giveaway on Monday at 5 Minutes for Mom.
An $11 million dollar project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coca-Cola Corporation are employing 50,000 Kenyan and Ugandan smallholders to produce fruit for Minute Maid, a subsidiary for Coca-Cola.
And our moods lie captive to the need.
The best thing about the film is its relative subtlety. When Albert fantasizes about finding a love of his own, he doesn’t want to cease dressing as a man or take a man as a lover. He identifies so absolutely as a man that he indulges in dreams of the little hotel maid Helen (Mia Wasikowska) sitting by his fire and darning his socks — oddly retrograde fantasies, considering that Helen’s not going to be anyone’s little wifey, but queer ones nevertheless. But the film takes its audience so seriously that it doesn’t feel the need to explain. Neither does Pariah need to explain why Lee is both gay and masculine-appearing, or why she wants to wear a strap-on dildo to the lesbian bar. These films let us do that work on our own.
One must give the benefit of the doubt that Brett actually believes what he says. He lived in South Africa, and is much more aware than the Western public about the complexity of the ANC movement.

Although it is deplorably and sickening to think that six farm-related murders have already occurred in South Africa during the first month of 2012, one must bear in mind that the January death-count related to violent crimes, is far higher than this figure. If we had to add to this figure the number of other deaths caused by vehicle accidents, for example, then I’m sure it’s safe to declare that the month of January 2012 was a blood-spattered one.

Way back in December I got this in a Glossy Box. This is, as far as I’m aware, only available from the Nouveau Beauty Group website for £14.99. The price seems to place it in the mid range of the mascara market. I certainly wouldn’t pay that much for a high street brand mascara but it’s less extortionate than higher end brands.

Yesterday had more to do with our little girl. She had a "I can't breathe, because I'm choking" moment Sunday night/Monday morning which scared her and terrified Mom and Dad. After some reading, we think she was choking on her own spit because she's teething, but whatever the reason, it took a long time to calm her down and I felt a need to sleep in after getting very little sleep that night, and therefore, did not blog.
Angus slowly regains consciousness. His family is by his side. There is no panic, no fear. I have never experienced this before. They are just by his side, holding his hand. Such peace. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that Angus is about to meet the Lord. The helicopter lands and another paramedic jumps out. Caleb, one of the best paramedics I know and trust.

I think I've developed a pattern. I eat....wait four months....then post the recipe. Nothing else. I stink as a blogger lately. ;-) My sincerest apologies. In my absence please enjoy the forty billion other blogs who actually make an effort. Life has changed around here in the last year....I would never have guessed 365 days ago that I would own a business...and a business that is CRA-ZEEEEE busy. Feel free to check that out if you like....it's fun.
All this and I hadn't even taken a shot. But that was next. Richard had me kneeling (hard on the poor knees on a wooden floor) with my left foot forward. “The left arm is out for balance, now swing the ball back and release it forward with the thumb at 10 or 11 o'clock. Aim for the second arrow, and don't forget the follow through.” Getting the hang of this 10 or 11 o'clock business was a lot harder than it sounded. Next we tried the one step drill, standing up. “The left knee has to be bent, and you slide into the shot with the right foot skewed behind to keep balance.” I also had to remember what to do with my hands and feet. How could I remember all that?

There are rules which, in my opinion, could be stricter, but I'm a hard woman to please. I love the countryside with a passion and want to protect it, and I'm sure the visitors who grace its environment are lovers of the countryside, too. People spend money in the countryside; apart from farming, tourism is a massive industry that keeps people in work and assists in giving holiday makers a memorable time. The area in which I live is no exception. We rely heavily on the tourism industry to help our economy and it's wonderful to see people enjoying the fresh air and the surrounding area, watching children have a fabulous time and seeing dogs being given their much needed exercise.
The story of this remarkable meeting between faiths and cultures goes back several years, when Radha Vallabha Dasa of ISKCON New York, who is currently working on a documentary on spiritual activism, envisioned a public conversation between Cornel West and the late ISKCON guru Bhakti Tirtha Swami. It made sense: Radha Vallabha admired both, they were both from the same generation, they were both from African American backgrounds and had similar experiences growing up, and they were both influential spiritual leaders.
So this is our fence along the driveway. We put up trellises every year. I planted sweet pea vines a week ago. They have popped up and started. I filled the baskets with pink and purple flowers.plants and vines.

Considering all the insanity occuring in the world right now and always, my piddly shit is nothing. I know this, which is why I never allow a pity party go on for too long.

Spotify Update Brings Pandora-Like Radio Stations – As expected, Spotify on Friday began rolling out a new version of its desktop software for Windows and Mac, adding several new features, including Pandora-like radio stations. Spotify version 0.8.3 allows users to create radio stations based on a particular playlist or album. Users can start a new radio channel from any playlist or album to listen to similar songs. The update also brings a new Instant Search feature that immediately displays search results.

I made no big deal about the test. I didn't make any effort to prepare her or tell her why we were taking the test, other than it might help us decide if we would be homeschooling again next year or not. that's all. No stress. No "GOOD LUCK", no "DO YOUR BEST", no "GO GETTEM TIGER". Nothing like that. She calmly followed the staff into the testing room with a quick smile and a wave over her shoulder as she went. OF course, I was barred from the testing room. Heaven forbid she have any family support.

My husband and I lived in London for a few years so, believe me, I know what I'm missing when it comes to a northern hemisphere Christmas. There's a certain magic about crisp winter evenings, streets strewn with twinkling lights, and chestnuts roasting on every city corner that we simply can't replicate in December, Down Under, hence the ever increasing popularity of the Christmas in July festivities here.

At trial, the prosecution called an eye witness to the robbery and shooting, who gave her account of events. The prosecution also introduced confessions from both Petitioner and Dodson.3 After the prosecution rested, both defendants invoked their constitutional right not to testify. The only witness called by either defendant was Dr. Rustico Dizon Garcia, a forensic psychiatrist, who had examined Dodson. Although he was called on Dodson’s behalf, the doctor testified that he had no opinion as to whether Dodson was legally sane, or insane, at the time of the robbery and murder.
Karan located an image of Raja Vikramaditya which I bowed to .. but did not feel was quite right. Not the right place. He then did some more locating and found a place near the lake between Mahakaleshwar and Hari Siddhi Mandir where there was a temple to Vikramaditya. This was the very place I was looking for and waiting to see for so long. I knew it was right as soon as I entered the place. After bowing to Durga Devi and admiring the pictures of the navaratnas of Raja Vikramaditya’s court and bowing to the Guru who had located this place after his narmada parikrama, I finally bowed to Raja Vikramaditya.
Millions of people worldwide are waking up to the fact that they are going to have a blog — no ifs, ands, or buts. That a blog — a personal marketing and communications device — is no longer a luxury. If you expect to stay on the cutting edge of the ‘net, you’re going to be a blog publisher, or else.

I had no previous knowledge that this cognitively impaired woman with a limited future lifespan was having such extensive dental surgery. There is much controversy about whether an individual with a prosthetic knee replacement even needs antibiotic prophylaxis with an antibiotic notorious for causing GI distress. There were additionally concerns on my part about the choice of a codeine based narcotic for pain control based on her existing medication list.
Actually, thinking about it, if I go onto Birdsnest.com.au and buy one item from Corporate Mummy, one from Party Granny and one from Playful Active that should come close to my personality today.

It is not comparable to the Award glut nowadays. The reason why an Award is given has no connection to a real merit anymore. The main reasons for Awards today are – a reward or return service for booked advertisement space, for booked floor space at exhibitions for getting famous people for promotion or to attract the press and to deliver the right pictures.
Remember Mitchell Graham--real name Mitchell Gross--the writer who set up a fake writing contest in order to promote his debut fantasy novel, and later on--much later--turned out to be a serial con artist? (Victoria blogged about Mitchell a few weeks ago, in connection with his indictment on charges of wire fraud and money laundering for allegedly luring a woman into investing millions of dollars in a phony company.)
I will be the first to tell you that I hate remodeling. Mostly because I hate things being in chaos and it would eventually lead to not having a bathroom in the middle of winter. Utah winters in the past were not kind. You would sometimes have to plow a walkway to the car through 3-4 feet of snow. This year it has been 3-4 inches.

Private medical firms include such treatments with health cash plans and the NHS was thought to spend around £4 million on homeopathy. The British Medical Association (BMA) has urged NHS trusts to stop including this type of treatment in their budgets and instead turn to more clinically-proven forms of treatment.

I took the time to go for a little walk around the site and it’s great to see some of the wonderful plots, It’s amazing just how much the place has changed since early March. Every plot has it’s own personality and you’d be amazed at how many ideas you’ll get and how many people you’ll get chatting to if you walk around. Gardeners seem to be the friendliest bunch, always happy to share some advice, or ask for some when it’s needed. It really is a great community. There was a gazebo on site the other day where they were selling plug plants, they had a great selection, including some unusual varieties. There’s such a great set up on site, the allotment shop has a great selection of all things garden related and the best thing is, all the proceeds go to the Epilepsy Care Foundation so it’s worth buying on site, when possible. You can even buy your shed and they will install it for you. I’m a particular fan of the tea/coffee van that visits every weekend, and last weekend, I spotted an ice cream van on site with a queue of allotmenteers lining up like kids to get their 99′s. I think I’ll stick to my cups of tea for now though, there’s still quite a chill in the air.

There are many ways to insult someone’s intelligence. My personal favorite is to answer a dumb question with a lie. Not a sarcastic answer, a total fabrication of truth. I like to see how long it takes for this person to find out the truth. I know that when they do, they will remember the lie I told them, and that is where my gratification comes in. This is, of course, only if I don’t like the person asking the dumb question. It’s never good to lie, unless you really don’t like the person you’re lying to. Then it is only moderately unacceptable.

Thank you for calling us to follow You LORD. The path of a disciple is the decision of humble obedience. You can use anyone and yet You have chosen us to be ministers of reconciliation.

What a great way to start off the new year! Since My Dreamy Start to 2012 fell through, I decided to spend the day out at the Alameda Point Antiques Faire to do a little treasure hunting. I think it had been almost a year since my last visit, so I took my time and spent almost seven hours walking, shopping, visiting with friends, and eating....a lot of eating.
1 PM Saturday. Last night I was to perform for a room full of grumpy old Jews in Exeter, south Devon. I expected to face sour, smug faces filled with resentment and bitterness of a people who weren’t living where they thought they belonged – in New York or at the very least, north London – and with no respect for me for having been crazy to leave New York and not successful enough for them to have heard of me.
It is fitting that my first review is of Wasatch Beer's Apricot Hefeweizen. It is fitting because many nights when I decide to knock a few back, its this beer that leads the way. The reason is for all of its tastiness, I cannot drink too much of it.

Is it morally wrong to kill people? Not really, argue two eminent American bioethicists in an early online article in the Journal of Medical Ethics. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, of Duke University, and Franklin G. Miller, of the National Institutes of Health believe that “killing by itself is not morally wrong, although it is still morally wrong to cause total disability”. Skipping ahead to the money quotes:

Napoleon started spreading lies about Snowball blaming him for everything that went wrong on the farm. When the other animals would question this, they were put down and isolated from the group until they agreed to believe the lies. Eventually, a pack of wild dogs attacked Snowball and drove him away once and for all. From that day forth, when anything broke on the farm or the benefits weren’t trickling down to the animals, it was blamed on Snowball. He was still creating havoc to ruin everything—or so the animals were told.

Within 5-7 days, the blisters will dry and scab over and are usually gone within 2-4 weeks. For 4 out of 5 people, they get better without complications. Approximately 1 in 5 people will develop pain which can continue for months or even years after the rash resolves. This condition which we call neuralgia can be debilitating and restrict a person’s quality of life. Rarely, serious complications can occur such as skin infections or scarring, pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain and nerve problems and rarely, death.

Katie Puckrik, an eloquent perfume reviewer on YouTube explains how Musc Ravageur is legendary as a ‘man-catcher’ and ‘bird-snatcher’: it makes men come on all wolfish but has women feeling 'Hello Kitty'. From my own sniffs, I agree with her that it has a ‘soft warm monkey business vibe’ infused with a ‘delicious animalic muskiness’. Nevertheless, at £90 a bottle, it was a bit expensive as a writer’s self-gift. So I contented myself with a deep sniff and a little tranche of impregnated cardboard for the Talina research file.
Transgression would also arise if a nation was attacked without first calling them to Islam. Muslims are ordained to call their enemies to Islam before fighting against them. If they refuse, Muslims should call them again to pay Jizya and submit to the laws of Allah (Subhanahu Wa ta’ala). If the enemy refuses again, Muslims should fight them in order that there be no persecution, and the Deen should be for Allah alone. This procedure should be observed, otherwise the limits have been transgressed and, “Allah verily loves not transgressors.”

Okay fooligans, here's the scoop. I'm going to try a writing schedule. I'll alternate weeks, 1 week with posts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 1 week with posts on Tuesday and Thursday.

I figured this would be the opportune time to start my newest weekly blog that will highlight and rank Wyoming’s eight NJCAA Division I men’s basketball teams. The hardwood has been full of excitement through about the first third of the Wyoming college hoops season and this week’s rankings indicate just how close a handful of teams are at the top. There are currently five (more than half) teams in the Cowboy State’s junior college ranks that have already hit double-digits in the win column. And if those teams can stay hot, this may just be one of the most exiting years in Wyoming junior college basketball.

When I finally found out I was having Maya (a name I had picked out before I even had any children), I was beyond excited. Over the moon. And then when she was born, I remember marveling at how exquisitely female she was. How petite and perfectly formed were her eyelashes, her chubby nose and her full lips. She was so different from her brothers that it instantly quelled the nature vs. nurture debate that I learned in college. No one had to teach her how to be feminine. It was all wrapped up in her being.
Genre Appeal: (7/10) – Lockout works as a lightweight action movie, not really demanding a whole lot out of the viewer, and it’s good to enjoy if you just want something breezy and fun that you don’t have to take seriously. It’s nothing new as far as action movies go, and it’s remarkably simplistic for a sci-fi movie, but if you just want cheesy good fun, this fits the bill.

We've spent the last few weeks prepping the garden for planting, including mulching the rows with wood chips. We lined them with empty feed bags to keep the weeds down, and piled the wood chips on top. It's a little thing, but it makes the garden feel so much nicer. We're going to build a long, narrow chicken run along the back fence as well. Nothing grows that close to the alders anyway, and I'm hoping the birds will keep the forest from encroaching on our little veggie plot.
I somehow managed to figure my way into a sitting position, feeling something like a floating genie, and spied a very old woman, creaking away in an equally-floating rocking chair, serenely knitting a blanket. "Grandma... Rachel?" I asked. Grandma Rachel had been dead for 20 years. This was most definitely a dream, no doubt brought on by all the cold medicine I had taken the night before.

Even if I have the main plot thought out as I get to know my characters (quirks, likes, dislikes, appearance, etc.) They will breathe further life into the story as I find out about their own backgrounds and how some of the pieces of their past directly affect how they deal with the unfolding situation they find themselves in. There are times when I’ll find myself boxed in with the storyline like scene that I have no idea where to go with next. Or perhaps I’ve just closed out a scene and I just can’t decide where to go next with the story. I of course know that long-term goal, but the intermediate scenes need more and I have to give the characters something else to do that will be relevant. On these occasions, I’ll go someplace to muse and think.
Harry was hailed as a hero by the American public, rather than a homicidal maniac. People admired the husband who stood up for his wife. They cheered him on during his trial, which was splashed all over the newspapers. It was all everyone could talk about.

The layout is Karen's Sweet Sunday Sketch. I took inspiration from her card and ruffled up my ribbon. The puppy, stamped butterfly, and sentiment are from my Penny Black Critter Party set (yes, I love this set and use it a lot....especially that birthday sentiment...hope you're not sick of seeing it). The main image is up on foam tape and Stickles were added for some pretty sparkle. The card measures 4" square.
“I’m here on behalf… no, perhaps I should start more simply. Mr. Doyle, are you acquainted with the scope of the universe?”
Things were looking good, and in May 1981, Woodham Brothers sold the locomotive to Procor (UK) Ltd in Wakefield, and she left as the 125th departure from Barry. After its departure from Woodham Brothers, it took 30 rail enthusiast volunteers 16 to completely rebuild and restore the 5972 to here original, Great Western glory. During this time, new flues and fire brick had to be installed, all the controls and gauges replaced, new driving rods installed and new super heater equipment installed. The 5972 was one of the most complete engines to depart Woodham Brothers, so rebuilding costs were manageable. The GWR 5972 “Olton Hall” debuted to the public as an operating steam locomotive sometime in 1997.

I went to bed, relatively early, with a planned 0300 start to my shift, but a bit after midnight I was awake with the pain from my wrist. I'd hoped it would settle and I'd be able to drive, but no, this was serious. No strength in my grasp and if I held my hand the wrong way or bumped my wrist, the pain would make me gasp.

The web’s emphasis on list-making has been well documented on the content side. Mashable‘s entire M.O. is to present content as numbered lists (preferably odd numbers). Or should I say, in their article “The Top 7 Ways for Mashable to Present Content,” list-making is #1. They admitted as much in a tongue-in-cheek article a few years back where they outlined how their writers gamed the system.

A series for younger readers, “I See the Sun”, is a great way to introduce early readers, five to seven years, to the world. The second addition is I See the Sun in Nepal written by Dedie King and illustrated by Judith Inglese ($12.95, Satya House Publications, Hardwick, MA, softcover) It is bilingual, written in English and Nepalese, and it portrays the essential cultural elements of Nepal through the eyes of a child. It is an excellent way to introduce a child to the way the world is made up of different nations, cultures, languages, and such. Coming in 2011 are others in the series devoted to Afghanistan, Russia, and India. The exotic State of Hawaii is the setting for Aloha, Kanani by Lisa Yee ($6.95, American Girl, softcover) that debuted in January, kicking off American Girl’s 25th birthday celebration. Kanani Akina is the 2011 Girl of the Year. She is a warm and cheerful girl, blessed to grow up in Hawaii and sharing the “aloha spirit.” Girls from the middle to later years of elementary school will enjoy this one as Kanani welcomes her cousin from New York, helps to rescue a baby Hawaiian monk seal, or assists older people in her community. Also on the same them from American Girl, is Lend a Hand: Girl-Sized Ways of Helping Others ($9.95, softcover) that offers all kinds of ways to help friends, family, animals, and neighbors for the pre-teen set. You can learn more about it and other titles at www.americangirl.com.

Kuntī brings her address to a close with this stunning spontaneous composition.
As the three grew, Larry couldn’t live in comfort knowing that his father has maybe or maybe not survived the battle against the Garden Gnomes. Until one day, a letter came along by Owl, and enclosed in the letter was a golden bracelet which he had to go to the country of Saddam-a-mort to throw into the burning oil wells and destroy. Upon the destruction of this bracelet, the wars of Central Earth would cease, and all the people that are wired by their heads into every outlet in the Pink Flamingos power lines will be freed and allowed to live as normal men of Central Earth, instead of living as a ‘renewable energy source.’

When we first moved in, I worked on Ella's room. It is a much bigger space than her old room so I needed to go to Level 1. I headed straight to Jo-ann's to do so. The home section there is very small, but you can get some neat finds on the cheap. I also knew that Ella's room had a garden fairy vibe so I hit the outdoor and spring section of Jo-ann's. Outdoor garden items make for adorable decorations. Here are some of the details:
This is not friendship. This is people putting up with someone they don’t want around who they know won’t come around if they act like this.

Something funny about this guy is that he told us few time ago he was gonna marry. Daisy told me that for sure there was an ‘engagement kid’ instead of an ‘engagement ring’ besides all this. My answer was ‘maybe they are truly in love’ but this time Daisy was right ))))))
Hopefully your boiling rage at my desertion will subside someday. I would rather enjoy sharing old tales over a mug of ale like we used to. Again, I appreciate the opportunities I have been given here, and wish you much success in the future.
I really liked the way these eye crayons went on; very smooth - gliding on like a dream. They blend out nicely, and once they set they're pretty long lasting.
It has been my observation that Christians who adopt the label of Messianic identify more with the tenets of Judaism than they do with the tenets of Christianity. Many reject the label of Christian altogether and some eventually even convert to Judaism.

My life is a hundred times better now. I'm no longer spending a minimum of 70 minutes per day traveling in the car. That's 350 minutes a week, which gives me almost 6 hours a week--24 hours a month--of "Linda time." And because I no longer have to get up at 6:15 a.m. to start the lengthy beautification process to make myself presentable to the world, I don't have to go to bed so damn early. I gain time there as well.

I’ve always disliked the mantra that you could die tomorrow so live for today, because it makes people not consider consequences and it leads to lonely, small and selfish people. But doing too much to aid the advent of tomorrow is equally poor planning and worrying about whether or not you’re doing enough can undermine the intended effect through stress.
We got to the start early enough that there wasn't a big crowd and I was able to use the toilet and warm up a bit before jumping into my corral. The corrals filled up almost immediately and were more crowded than any race corral I've ever been in. I could count the women around me on one hand and as we crossed the start, we headed out to take the streets of Madrid.

I have no idea why they invited me to join them--or maybe I invited myself because that sounds like something I would do--but I'll tell you this, those women taught me more about mothering than any book ever could because between them they had, oh I don't know, a hundred million years of parenting experience and it doesn't get more real than that. Each of them was vivacious and dynamic and interestingly, we met for lunch at a place called, "Smoky Davis" famous for its smoked meat sandwiches.

A report prepared by the eight-nation Arctic Council released on Monday said, the rising global demand for oil and gas is increasing the activity in the Arctic. The increased activity will enhance the risk of oil spills in the region.

But Le Corbeau ain’t just any old film. This taut, tightly wound 91m film is a despairing and morally complex look at the things that damaged people living in a dangerous time will do. That it is a thinly-veiled examination of the many difficulties of living in Vichy France is the common wisdom today, though that allegorical aspect of the film seems to have initially slipped past the folks at Continental-Film who okayed the film and the censors who allowed its release. So there’s some interesting meta-criticism going on w/r/t the film, in that folks wonder about the morality of taking money from the Nazis, while making a final product that is essentially anti-Nazi. ‘Tis a real head scratcher, that one. But, in the end, for any film of this sort to succeed, it must work at both literal AND allegorical level, and Le Corbeau most certainly does that.
And the second thing is that a couple of people have contacted me to say that they are judges for the folk awards and were very happy to see my blog posts. So I was thinking that if there are any other judges out there who'd like to "out" themselves in the name of transparency - since the BBC and Smooth Operations agree that there has never been anything preventing them from doing this - you could email me here and if there is a decent sized handful I could write a separate post about what the folk awards look like from that point of view.
For most of the Silver Age, DC did not include credits for their stories (although it was not uncommon for artists to sign their work). Indeed, probably the most common credit given was fictitious; the one that identified most Batman stories as being drawn by Bob Kane.
Today we had a little retirement party for my favorite teacher of all time. As one of several former students on the faculty at My Small Town High School, I was requested to offer a little speech to commemorate what she had meant to me.
I asked Santa for a copy of Rocky Horror that Christmas, and he obliged. The cassette was displayed on the mantle above my stocking on Christmas morning, alongside my sister's copy of Heathers. And I sat and I watched it, several times over several weeks. I had a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
Not surprisingly, any of Jane Austen’s novels. They have all the magic ingredients of timeless romantic comedy – brilliant plotting, characters we care passionately about, wit and laugh-out-loud humour. And, for me, her attention to language means that I can read her books over and over again, even though I know them so well.

I already know the response to my criticism but here it goes: Almondine’s pain au chocolat is delicious. Superb, even. Light, flakey pastry, slightly browned and crunchy at the ends. Chewy and moist, it tastes like it was only moments ago pulled from the oven.
However, and sorry to put a bit of dampener on this great beery moment, if I had to say one thing though, it's that a lot of the brewery's descriptions seriously let them down.

How's that for alliteration? If you read my blog last week, you'll know that it was my first week at my graduate job! It was nerve-wracking, confusing and overwhelming, but really really exciting too. I wasn't given too many tips or restrictions when it comes to attire, with my boss simply stipulating 'it would probably be best to dress how you would for a job interview', but I played it really safe my first week. The first day my makeup was incredibly neutral (and disgusting, I pretty much sweated it all off before I got there because of nerves) and I got a little more adventurous as the week went on. I took cues from the other girl who works there (there are only 2 other people on our team), since she seems to be into makeup too.

Pharmacists should be as well versed at recommending these alternatives as they are at recommending drug therapy. When possible, less medication is always best.
I actually do have the boyfriend with a talent for photography that is every fashion blogger's dream but as he’s a very busy man I almost always do my own outfit shots. I just can’t bring myself (or have time) to prance around London with a tripod, camera and remote to take forty photos of myself posing like a model as I find it cringingly embarrassing. I'd rather take photos in the privacy of my own home but don’t have a spot I'm happy with to get the images I want. I dislike images produced with flash photography which limits when I can take photos as there is often not enough natural light in cloudy old London even when I go outside.

Of course, I hate this industrial litter. It's vile. Disgusting. Poisonous. But it's also fascinating, and maybe a little inspiring. They could be remnants of a lost underwater civilization. A litterbug Atlantis. They could be space trash that has fallen into the ocean and washed up on our shores. Maybe these elements rust so quickly because they are made of Terbinium and thus only adapted to the atmosphere of Mars.
Never once did I allow my characters to be truly humiliated or embarrassed by their own actions. Why? Because I was afraid they might embarrass me. And that was not okay.
It sounds like the same old assimilationist rubbish that hasn't worked and can't work. Immigrants from anywhere in the world and any race are fine as long as they adopt "British culture"? What British culture is left to assimilate to in places like London, where half the population is from Timbuktu and Pakistan?
It means that, as violently angry as people become when any boundaries of sex are brought up . . I have to stand by them. I can’t endorse homosexuality, because the Bible says it’s wrong. People may hate me all they want, but that wasn’t my decision to make. My decision to make–and I am responsible for this one–is to choose who I will serve. And I have chosen. And the King I follow says homosexuality is wrong. But that’s not all, although it seems to be the one people most remember. Pornography, sex outside of marriage, rape, crude language–all are wrong to God. And so all are wrong to me.
Pray for the team returning. They are in the middle of a thirty-hour odyssey as they come home. Ask God to help them adjust to our time zone, adapt to what has happened here, and to try to share what God has done in them with passion, grace, and tact.

School Food Service Journal
Shane did not ask Rickey to recite the sinner’s prayer and then leave him at the altar of the Baptist church for them to take care of. Shane asked Rickey if he could come to his home once a week for the next few months to bring the teachings of Jesus and the community of God’s people to share with his whole family and any friends he would like to invite. This was the way of sharing the Gospel and making disciples that Shane’s pastor, Neal, had been leading in their church for a couple of years, inspired by Training for Trainers, taught to Neal by Jeff Sundell, who had learned it in the decade he and his family did CPM training in Nepal and East India. It was at least a year-long commitment for both of them, and their families. Now Rickey is teaching that group, along with Shane and some others, and their home group has bounded to over twenty. When I was there Rickey’s and Shane’s daughters were piled together in a bean-bag chair, wearing dueling Duke and Carolina pajamas, for the night of the Duke-UNC basketball face-off. They have a lot more to share now that both their dads are leading their families in the struggles, pains, hopes, and victories of the Christian life.

Democracy is incredibly powerful and exciting. It’s also nuanced and complex. It’s bizarre that some people think that there is only one correct way to make a decision when you’re at the voting booth. Honestly, we should all just be thrilled to death that people are giving their vote that much consideration. Thinking strategically and making a thoughtful, reasoned decision should be celebrated.
But driving to work today—Sitting in Traffic Meditation—something occurred to me: If every conference we attend has a theme, the theme of this one was not "A Series of Unfortunate Events" but "How Unschoolers Respond to Suffering."
For many reasons, which I won't go into here, our paths diverged with E more than we would have liked as college progressed. L and I were able to maintain a close friendship over the years and distance. We probably grew even closer than ever. But there was always a part of 'us' missing.

Headaches and Heartaches. Not much to say about this song except that it is one of my favorites. It was brought in as a totally finished number by Sam and we all kind of said "Yeah but it should go like this" and totally changed his arrangement! It's simply a pleasure just to play on this song. More than anything I thoroughly enjoyed the entire recording process of it. Sam and I got to sing the backing vocals 'live' together in the studio (including doing a crazy kind of dance together which has me grinning from ear to ear just thinking about it) and I also had the pleasure of opening the can of beer at the end and talking those great big gulps. Ahhh. Just a great song. I love it.

I am really pained by our gross underachievement as a race. Instead of regarding bitter truths expressed by the likes of Watson as a wake-up call for us to engage in sober reflection, we take to the expression of woolly sentiment. For me, this type of reaction is a further evidence of our unintelligence. A man of intelligence recognises genuine criticism against him and takes steps to improve himself in order to prove his critics wrong. But for us blacks, our reaction is to abuse the man who expresses worries about our backwardness.

Starting and stopping, at least with the two experienced stokers that I enjoyed on our weekend, wasn’t all that different other than having to be better about keeping the tandem absolutely upright and getting both feet down for longer stops. On the two-place tandems, Debbie knows to off-set her weight to the left when I put my left foot down and lean the bike to the right: that’s a bozo-no-no on the Triplet… I almost dumped the bike and my stokers in the parking lot when I tried that on Sunday.

We also know that you have not made a profit for some time…However, to recognise the fact that you are the only person on this planet who can lead your business, & to take into account the untold personal sacrifices that you have had to make as a person managing your business…please pay yourself a bonus equivalent to 150% of your salary each year from now on, Oh & forget the effect that this will have to your balance sheet”.

On both trips we enjoyed fries. The first time we had truffle fries which I found to be crunchier and overall less greasy than Blanc’s with every bit as much of the funky, rich truffle aroma. On the recent trip I tried the Cajun fries which were the same in texture but lightly dusted with a seasoning that was great but, admittedly, I couldn’t really taste due to the strength of the burger’s accoutrements.
When I woke up this morning, my hair was a nest of hairspray and cigarette smoke. The eyeliner that I had lazily left on had migrated south of my cheekbones and there was a patina of glitter on my pillow. And when I got into the shower I noticed very angry-looking red rings forming little halos around my nipples.
Smuttynose IPA also comes with some welcoming mung at the bottom of the bottle (remember, I like Belgian beers and always pour them out to the very end to get that yeasty, B-vitamin goodness). The aroma is a bit weak, but the flavour is complexly bitter over a slight biscuitiness. It’s not clearly floral nor piney nor citrus, but all those together in small amounts and all combining to add up to a rich taste.

Hi Everyone! Just thought I'd blog about how my Christmas turned out, I hope every one of you all had a wonderful celebration with family and friends. Christmas is my absolute favorite holiday and every year I always look forward to decorating with my family and best of all getting a freshly cut Noble Fir, just love the smell of it. It's definitely a blessing to have my family all gathered at my house to open up gifts. The best is when my mom always cooks up a fantastic meal for all of us. Below are just a few shots I took on my phone of the girls on Xmas morning.
K: This has to be handled in a graduated fashion. I’ll explain. Let’s imagine a fictitious situation, whereby the terrorists have forced 20 children onto the roofs of every single building in Gaza that has been marked as a target because it has terrorists in it. That’s what I see in my reconnaissance photographs. Every single roof is covered with children.
I have found that most psychologists, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are not only extraordinarily compliant with authorities but also unaware of the magnitude of their obedience. And it also has become clear to me that the anti-authoritarianism of their patients creates enormous anxiety for these professionals, and their anxiety fuels diagnoses and treatments.

In the interim, the gang has been playing a lot of (sadly unpainted) Dystopian wars. As usual with a new game, we continue to figure out new rules we're forgetting, but we're getting much closer to rules transparency with every game. I'm learning the shortcomings and strengths of the Brit fleet. Likewise I'm learning to love the echelon formation, more lovingly dubbed the "Broadside Conga Line". Those hull-ripping submersibles need to be released, like, yesterday. I'm seeing a fleet based on Dreadnaughts, frigates, bombers, and Vanguard subs. Delicious!

Another growing online print and self-publishing solution in the Netherlands is Pumbo. Again, it seems to be modelled on services like Lulu, Cafepress and Unibooks. A brief look at Pumbo suggests to me that the profits for the author solutions provider are loaded heavily into the price of books to the author. A 125 page standard paperback coming in at a whopping €17+ with the equivalent ebook edition priced at €12+! There is also a delivery charge to add on depending on the amount of units ordered.
Dear President Jonathan,
5th of March 2012
I am in NO WAY like a great deal of mothers who feel that they can teach their son’s how to be men!
For example: I could write about emotions. Just recently I had someone say to me that they would like to adopt so they don't have to deal with all the emotions that come along with having a baby. Whoa! I could write about that one for sure. But do I??? We've got emotions and two years later we still got them. I never had postpartum depression with Jenna but I might say the emotions we go through as adoptive families are equal to that for sure. I could write about special needs b/c over the past year that's become a reality for us. But do I???? While I want others to know they are not alone I want to be protective of my family and our story.
It is amazing how organized this software is. All the kits are sorted, and everything that matches, always seems to be right there where you need it! The best part is when you download them from My Memories, they are automatically stored within the software, so you don't have to go searching for it when you need it!

“Oh, my dear fellow, if you want to be a gentleman you must give up being an artist. They’ve got nothing to do with one another. You hear of men painting pot-boilers to keep an aged mother – well, it shows they’re excellent sons, but it’s no excuse for bad work. They’re only tradesmen. An artist would let his mother go to the workhouse.”
Less than three weeks till the Marine Corps Historic Half! I’m starting to get really excited about this one, even though it kicks my butt every year. But I’m still optimistic after my performance in Charlottesville, and now that I have more time in the afternoons and evenings, I can concentrate fully on training. This last month or so before school gets out is always tricky because it starts to get really hot by the time I get home, and I’m less likely to run if I wait till later in the evening. In the summer I get to run first thing in the morning, which is ideal. I guess I could go to the gym right after school, but I hate everything about that place, so I’d rather avoid it if at all possible. Yet I still hang on to my membership… I guess I just have to take it week by week.
If all I could do was peruse the market, I would be content with that. But as luck would have it, I did get to do a bit of cooking during this trip. I knew I wanted to make a seafood dish but the question was which seafood. It's funny how an abundance of fish, clams, and fresh water crab can confuse a usually decisive person. In the end, I settled with squid. My plan was to fry it and serve with a dressing made up of fresh garlic, jalapenos and culantro. Not cilantro. Culantro.

Bjorn Lomborg took an interesting approach: Let’s presume that man has had an impact on global warming, what will the results be if man implements the plans that governments have laid out. He concluded that governments will get much more powerful and have all sorts of control, the economy will be severely burdened, people’s quality of life will suffer and if we are lucky the globe will warm one hundredth of one degree less.

Happy new year! It is going to be a busy one for me, preparing for a new book and solo show in early Autumn. First though, I am taking part in The Courtauld Institute of Art's East Wing X: Material Matters show. This opens from the 21th January at the Institute in Somerset House in London - but being a working college it is only open to the public on the last Saturday of each month. If you want to catch the show though, it runs until June 2013, which should give you plenty of opportunity. I have a mix of older and newer work in the show, including the image above, taken near Somerset house at the end of last year. You can also see work by War Boutique, Laura Keeble, Gabriel Dawe, Paula Rego, Damien Hirst, Simon Edmonson and over 30 other artists. My work is downstairs in the cafe, so if you get there early you can probably grab a fry-up too. Find more info here.
The Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS), the Weeksville Heritage Center and Irondale Ensemble Project have been chosen to receive two major federal grants to fund their joint project “In Pursuit of Freedom,” a multifaceted program that memorializes the history of abolitionism and the Underground Railroad in Brooklyn.
Neighbouring Prides: The Sohebele pride occupied the central region of Motswari’s traversing, and as a result, this kept most of their neighbours on the periphery of the reserve. To the north, it was the Jacaranda Pride; to the north-west it was the Timbavati Pride; to the west it was the Voel Dam Pride; in the south-west it was the Ross Pride; to the south it was the Machaton Pride; to the east it was the old Mayumbuya Pride.
Hania kept asking me whether I had figured out the being’s identity. No, I hadn’t. She seemed highly amused by my cluelessness. Finally, unable to contain herself any longer, she told me who he was. I was completely surprised, despite knowing all about her channeling relationship. I had been confused by his ordinariness, I explained, having previously encountered him as a much more impressive presence. She said that he sometimes appears in this very human guise, and other times shows his larger self. Well, that’s true of those of us who are embodied, too, and so it seems quite plausible to me. Here are her words: “Jesus Christ, out of His love for me, makes Himself as large or small as is needed to allow me to be with Him best at the time. Our relationship has an aspect of being friends, and He will make Himself to whatever scale is most reassuring for me at the time, so I can maintain this feeling, so as not to intimidate me and throw me off ’the friends’ track.’ Sometimes He is immeasurable, other times as you experienced Him then.”
If you are a Canadian and insist upon the latter, please know that it’s embarrassing. You sound ignorant. You sound American. (For the Americans out there, I’m sorry. I might touch on my view on the American-Canadian thing later. No major offense intended, honestly.) We will forgive you though. We probably won’t even say anything. We don’t want to hurt your feelings, or anything.
I’ve noted on January 28th that I went to the boat for the first time since Rob had died. I wondered if Rob had left any note of any kind in the safe on the boat. Wasn’t really expecting it as we’d discussed everything, but knew I had to get into the safe. Had a struggle but with the help of his friend Mike, we got in. There was no note, just Rob’s valuables, his jewellery, etc. I noted that I was surprisingly unemotional.

We were in the second row from the front so we had a great view. It was really quite a small set, bless it. I did take some photos of the actual set, but since we weren't technically supposed to, I shan't post them on here just in case I get an angry email from the BBC ...

The process was based on cladding strategies used on larger scale projects with non orthogonal geometries, like the Walt Disney concert Hall in Los Angeles. The complex topography of the side wall forms was analyzed to smaller triangular or trapezoid surfaces. The forms are separated into two basic elements: structure and “skin”. The structure was laser cut iron members that were welded and mounted on the side walls, forming a “skeleton” that would carry the “skin”; the plywood surfaces. All surfaces are mapped out, numbered and cut “sur mesure” from 2.50X1.20m plywood sheets.

I have a little wish regarding Rufus’ summer tour: He is starting a wide-scale tour, actually as of yesterday 30 April opening with aLondon concert; covering homelandCanada, US, andEurope. I wish he would fit aTurkey concert somewhere within one of the little empty parts of the schedule (anywhere in June or July before he goes back to US), or that I find the chance to listen to him live somewhere along the tour. If he comes, that would be his second visit toTurkey after the 2008 concert that I unfortunately missed. I cannot bear to miss him another time.

This record does not contain a clear indication that the applicant departed from the general rule for the article "a." Nothing in the claim language, specification, or prosecution history compels an exceptional reading of "a" in this case. The district court erred by misapplying the term "said fabric roll" later in the claim and the phrase "in intimate contact with the fabric roll" in the specification. Initial Order, slip op. at 8. As noted above, the use of a definite article ("said" or "the") to refer back to an initial indefinite article does not implicate, let alone mandate the singular. Because the initial indefinite article ("a") carries either a singular or plural meaning, any later reference to that same claim element merely reflects the same potential plurality. In grammatical terms, the instances of "said fabric roll" in the claim are anaphoric phrases, referring to the initial antecedent phrase. Because the initial phrase carries no definitive numerosity, the anaphoric phrases do not alter that meaning in the slightest.

Compared to what we have from where I come from (the Philippines), everything in America is super-sized, or is geared to being one. And I mean, everything! That includes houses, cars, buildings, clothes, furniture, grocery items, fast food items and all things you can think of. I believe this is one of the results of a free enterprise. Competition is tough, that’s why every company there is has to fight tooth and nail to get their market. And how? Well, by catering to one of human nature’s weakness -greed - and sending messages that inculcate within us “the bigger, the better” mentality.

The snow balls were so dense and so big that I had to gently break them up with an ice pick. The next tool, and one that Bisou has always been wary of, was the hair dryer. But this time she seemed to understand her situation, and submitted. I let her finish drying off and relax the rest of the afternoon, and waited until evening to tackle the mats.
I bought the magazine (Burda 03/12) on Thursday and finished sewing the dress on Sunday. The only reason it took that long was because I had to wait till Saturday to get to Spotlight for thread and a zip.

An incident at the uni 2 weeks ago beats last year’s hands down. On a fine Wednesday morning, while I was working at the office, I got a text message from a guy who saw my Car-For-Sale ad (will talk about why I’m selling in the next section). Overwhlemed by excitement, I got totally disoriented. All I knew was I needed to get home ASAP.

On the HAED BB my yearly goal was to stitch 4 pages of her, and i would like to nearly be there, as after page 4 ( not that i have finished page 3 yet) there is only 1 3/4 pages to stitch and a lot of them are blocks of colour.

Siggi Loch’s journey has followed a trajectory all of its own. After stumbling across the music of Sidney Bechet at the age of 15, he formed a band and began dreaming of running his own jazz label. Half a century ago he was among the R&B fans getting a first taste of The Beatles at the Star Club in Hamburg. Soon afterwards he produced some of the first tracks by the pop group The Searchers as he embarked on a career as a talent-spotter, producer and major label executive.
I believe God wants to accomplish some big things in our lives. These things can only be accomplished by the Lord working through people of faith so that He might receive all the glory. Have you arrived at the place where your faith is fully available for Him to use?
“Our best seller is the goat’s milk lotion,” she said. “We sell a lot of that. I use it everyday. If I have a cut, scrape, burn, or bruise, I put it on there because it has these wonderful healing properties. Even my husband and son use it now. But, I use it everyday. I take a long bath and then I dab it on to my face afterwards.”

The fourth installment of this children’s animated franchise is back once again with its stars Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo, as Manny, Diego and Sid. There are a lot of all new characters voiced by people such as Jennifer Lopez to Peter Dinklage. This time the story revolves around the continents splitting apart after the end of the ice age and the gang must make their way across the sea. It’s a fun series and parents will definitely take their kids to see another one of these.
But it is only logical to assume that a payment was in fact made. There would have been no incentive for Ansar Dine to release the woman otherwise. Moreover, Islamic law permits the collection of ransoms after abducting non-Muslims—a precept with which Ansar Dine is certainly familiar. Ansar Dine probably has a little more spending money today than it had prior to the Stockly affair.

April 7– Monday– Washington, D.C.– Lord Lyons, the British Minister, reports to the Foreign Secretary regarding the treaty on cooperation in suppression of the slave trade. “I have . . . this morning signed the Treaty; and I have, in deference to Mr. Seward’s opinion, admitted the Clause limiting the duration. . . . the Senate does not always confine itself to ratifying or rejecting a Treaty absolutely. It very frequently makes amendments or alterations. It appears, therefore, to be more consistent with the Dignity of the Queen, that even if Her Majesty approve of the Treaty as it stands, Her Ratification should not be given, until it is certain that the President has been authorised by the Senate to give the Ratification of the United States.”

Just saw the Avengers movie last night with my gaming group. Very cool and very, very fun, although there was definitely at least one "DAMN YOU WHEDON!!" moment. Then of course we spent the rest of the night spouting quotes and reminding each other of scenes we had just seen less than an hour ago.
At the end of the first day, we were exhausted and hungry and sad. It was hard to be there and the faint memory of those warm fuzzy feelings from that morning were just that, a faint memory. In total, we spent about a week there and between four and five hours per day.

Not bad for 90 minutes of work. It would have been less, but I had to get passed reading the instructions! In my opinion, its easier to take it one step at a time...don't read ahead!

As I sat looking out over the water I realized I was holding my breath waiting for movement. I think there is a lesson to be learned. We try to move through different life stages seamlessly. We even wear our flexibility like a badge of honor. I like the idea that nature has built in a period of rest... time to heal, repair, accept change...find our footing again before sending us rushing in a different direction.

But then we move here, and suddenly it’s like I can’t wait to get away from him. I want to work extra hours and not because of the pay. I want to spend all the time I can downstairs at my sisters so I don’t have to talk to him. Or worse, hear him talk. He doesn’t ever want to talk about anything important to us, as a couple, only what he heard on the radio that day or saw on the news or read on line. He’s worked a whole 5 days since November as a temp at the book bindery that my brother in law works at. He’s not looked for a real job since right before Christmas. His car needs a new alternator. His phone bill is out of control. He wants a new this and a new that and he complains all the time about the house (which was built in the 40’s and taken very good care of ever!) is too cold too drafty too…whatever. It snows too much in Wisconsin. It’s too cold for him to go jogging. He wants his own garage. He wants his own laundry room so that I don’t have to go all the way downstairs to use my sister’s. He hates my brother in law (don’t worry, it’s mutual) and doesn’t want to be down there when he’s there. Which makes it pretty hard for him to be down there because my BiL hates for anyone to be over when he’s not home (I dunno, he just does). But that’s okay since I go down there to get away from him anyways!

In the celebratory speech given by Adams in 1862, which I think we can now assume was based largely on information supplied by Foster himself, he boasted of having been married five times, and to have fathered 17 children, with the oldest daughter born c.1784. The last of these claims is obviously unrealistic, if we now accept that he was born in 1774, and would have been a mere 10 years old at the time. While I have only found evidence for two children, I accept there may well have been several others.
It’s rare that I bake a cake. Apart from the fact that my baking acutraments leave something to be desired, 2 out of 3 of us in residence aren’t that fussed about cake.

Personally, I think the guy has been scammed. Wasn't all this just a little too easy?

Phlebotomist, what an odd word; imagine introducing yourself at parties as a phlebotomist. Martha supposed she would become familiar with all the odd idiosyncrasies of medical lingo in the coming months. Perhaps she could drop a few of them into conversation during some of her own social gatherings, just to gain that sense of superiority that would be destroyed when the doctor completed this sentence.
“It so does not make sense to allow the kinds of contaminants that are routinely in sewage sludge … onto our farm fields, to allow them to be put on pasture land where cows graze that give us milk,” said Maureen Reilly of the group Sludge Watch.

Unaccompanied by a canine companion, I could walk through the park as if invisible. On the few occasions when I had custody of a friend's dogs, however, suddenly I became quite noticeable. The leash, the collar, the wagging tails were my passport, the secret handshake that grants entrance into the private club. Fellow dog walkers and owners came over to say hello and chat. With two dogs trotting close to my heels, I was immediately embraced within the doggy community. The only thing more effective at attracting attention would've been pushing a carriage with a cute baby in it.
The meek behaviour and fear of authority shown by ex-detainees, the intimidating and domineering posture of the security personnel, attempted and successful suicides committed by ex-prisoners such as Leon Madakeni, "Mark", and Nonhlanhla Makhuba when faced with the possibility of re-arrest, and the common mental disturbance of the guards and personnel at Quatro, and what they talked about in their deranged state, threw light on what one was likely to expect in this "rehabilitation centre".

But that’s just what happened this week. I pulled off the road, and after just a few minutes I saw two wolves running down a slope, straight at me. They spooked a big horn sheep, who ran up the slope. They came within a couple of hundred feet of me, and were joined by another wolf. The three of them tussled around, and I got to watch them, by myself, for about 15 minutes before other people came. Cars did drive by, but I think because I don’t have one of those big scopes, no one thought I was seeing anything. Fine with me!

He looked at his watch and stared solemnly down the hallway at the front door, half expecting it to spring open with his daughter in tow. It didn’t and he let out a slight moue as his focus switched to the dried and cracked lambs blood above the door of his daughters room. Not a good sign. He hoped Carmen would return soon. He walked back over to the alter, knelt down in front of it, lit some candles and a stick of incense. He silently uttered a few incantations of protection, adding a prayer or two for God to forgive him for his transgressions but he held little hope for this, after all, why would God forgive you when you can’t forgive yourself? Sighing deeply he went back to packing his things.

At this point, as my readers have doubtless guessed, we’ve strayed into the realm of magical combat. You’ll notice that lightning bolts from wands and incantations in bad Latin are not involved; those belong to cheap fantasy fiction, not to actual magic. Instead, the combat is a struggle of narratives or, if you will, of ways of structuring experience. Among the tools that practitioners of mass thaumaturgy use to weave their spells are emotionally charged images and ideas that trigger the hardwired binary reaction in our brains. Among the effective options for doing battle with them, in turn, is ternary logic, which defuses the binary reaction so that whatever issue is up for discussion can be put back into its actual context, and is no longer seen exclusively through the filter of food/nonfood, predator/nonpredator, and the like.

As the 'bridge' book in this trilogy, Underworld does not disappoint. Oftentimes the second book is considered the filler and often riddled with unnecessary plot lines to extend a series, but Underworld is quite the opposite. If anything, this book has just built this story up to a perfect climax, leaving the reader at the edge and ready to crash down to an incredible conclusion. Be prepared to be completely blown by this book and fall even harder for the King of the Underworld.

The favorite dessert is prepared using yeast or baking powder and baking soda. But now I tried using active dry yeast. It turns out so soft and delicious. After fermented, the batter becomes very thick so you need to add extra water otherwise it was unable to spread. Once the bubbles appear, drizzle with butter, sprinkle with ground peanut and sugar, continue cooking until the bottom turns golden brown, fold in half.
Yes, the 24-plank machine-controlled set is a rather ugly and distractingly noisy thing. Yes, Robert Lepage's production suggests someone reliant more on momentary inspiration than on grand overarching vision. And sure, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra's performance under Fabio Luisi mostly seemed blandly competent rather than inspired. All of this may well start to bug me more in the later, longer installments of Lepage's new production of the complete Ring cycle, if not corrected. For the relatively trim Das Rheingold, however, there were just enough moments of visual splendor—the planks contorting to create a distorted stairwell, for instance, as well as some of the video projections—to satisfy me. And, of course, the opera itself is glorious; its thematic elements—its skeptical view of man's folly, the damaging effects of unchecked power on the human soul, etc.—still come through amidst Lepage's technological gimcrackery, and the music is still as brilliant as ever. For a novice of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung live, this was fine. Not transcendent, not thought-provoking, and not especially affecting, but fine. We'll see how the rest of this new Metropolitan Opera production shakes out.

I hope this will bring about more brewers to put on full flavored low alcohol session beers. The simple fact is that if a brewer can get maximum flavor out of a true session beer I will drink drink anything that brewer ever makes from that point on. It is truly a skill. 15 malts and 20 hop varieties might sound like a neat novelty, but that isn't a beer you want to come back to again and again.

I could not resist God anymore, so I got up. But before I opened my laptop I asked Him to confirm the message with His Word. I got my Bible and asked Him to let me open to the verse that would confirm the message and its urgency. I shivered because what I saw immediately as I opened my Bible is this: LAMENTATIONS in bold letters, and the first 2 verses which the Complete Jewish Bible says:
The good thing, for people who shrink at the thought of having to create new and exciting activities from scratch every week, is that we have so many holidays and special occasions as a family, as a country and across the globe from which to draw inspiration. More on that later.

We all knew that VB was the single biggest selling beer in Melbourne because, well, it’s the biggest selling beer in Australia – has been since God’s dog was a pup! What we didn’t now was that “the beer we drink does vary according to our postcode,” the article suggested. It then contradicted itself by saying that VB was the top-selling beer in liquor shops IN EVERY STORE SURVEYED IN MELBOURNE AND REGIONAL VICTORIA. Excuse me, but have you seen my ‘variance’??

According to the researchers, this method of understanding market connections could help each country predict when a financial crisis is imminent, allowing it to set up policies that will protect their own markets from becoming dangerously intertwined with struggling markets.

The true heroes are the young men and women who put on their uniforms and fight; not because they love war or violence (or because I do), but because they are prepared to stand up for what they believe in against an implacable, unenlightened foe. More than that, the fact they are willing to serve and risk all is the only thing which stands between the likes of Miss Katz and death or slavery. Whatever they think of her, they allow her to exist; the reverse is not and cannot be true.
The officer went to his car with John’s license and sat on the radio for several minutes as John walked to the Mustang. He took only a few steps before the officer’s spot light hit him from behind, causing a slight stutter-step as he neared the trunk of the car. As he peeked in the rear passenger-side window to see Charlotte still asleep, the spot light faded. John turned back towards the police car and walked slowly, hands in his front pockets, as he watched distant headlights approaching followed by tail lights shrinking away. One particular set of headlights grew closest, followed by a rectangular set of yellow lights that outlined the trailer of an eighteen-wheeler rumbling towards him. As it drew near, he closed his eyes and accepted the burst of warm air and exhaust left in its wake.

I've only used the first two chapters with my kids so far and I can't wait to see how they take to some more lessons. Lately I've felt that my class has lost some excitement and urgency during Daily 5, and Comprehension Connections is giving us all a new way to think about reading. I hope you check this book out and let me know what you think!
If you already read my blog, I hope you’ll encourage me with comments and likes, and good will along the way.

Tuesday we toured Grand Teton. We had lunch at the Signal Mountain Lodge where I ate my first elk chili. I didn't take my camera with me unfortunately. Too bad since the views from the dining room were spectacular. The chili was good, but if you hadn't told me it wasn't beef chili, I wouldn't have known.
Keep in mind, most babies are fairly active inside the womb and they turn a lot — even during labor. So, chances are, whatever position your baby is in now will not be the same position he or she will be in a few hours from now.
It is worth noting that each of these positive measures takes aim at one or two of the factors that have led to decline. The Benedict option seeks to break the hold of political polarization on the church. The postmodern opportunity aims to re-engage the cultural elites. The next Christendom has already strongly undermined the contention that Christianity merely reflects Western culture and imperialism. And if there is an “age of diminished expectations,” it could erode both the materialism and even the sexual licentiousness (which always works best in the midst of material plenty) that have undermined faith.

How much would the developer earn? That’s tough to calculate, because we don’t know how many suites would be sold at different price points. At an average of 30% of the top price, the average suite would cost $139,200. At 40%, the cost would be $185,600. At 50%, it would be $232,000.
Least of all, your social life is going to have an entirely new character. You might lose track of single non-parenting friends. You might not have time for much socializing at all depending on the health and temperment of your baby. But there are also opportunities to meet an entirely new group of people because you’re in the parenting club now. But how exactly will this happen?
Athens was a city that I was really looking forward to going to. After going to Rome and seeing all of these ancient ruins, mixed in with amazing architecture, fountains on every corner I had really high expectations for Athens. I was at first really disappointed as we drove through crazy, busy streets with really modern, simple architecture and graffiti EVERYWHERE. My first impression was Ah, typical big city.

As an early childhood educator, I realize that teaching little ones involves a lot of preparation. Maria Montessori referred to it as "the prepared environment." Many hours are spent before the child even enters the classroom, not only deciding which lessons will be taught and how, but every detail of the classroom. Thought goes into which materials are placed on the shelf, their most advantageous placement, and how they might be used (the intended uses as well as the not-so-intended) by the children. (It's this same "teacher think" that makes me cringe when others buy my children any sort of stick-like toy. I can just imagine the possibilities . . .)
The best and the worst thing about Hellboy 2 is how it looks. As I mentioned, for the second installment Guillermo Del Toro has dispensed with a human protagonist, and along with it, any real grounding in the world of man. Humans here do little more than scream and run away, and even the awesome Jeffrey Tambor is pretty much put on the shelf by the time the real action gets going. Hellboy 2 is immersed in the world of demons, fairies and trolls, with Del Toro exercising his creature-concepting skills to their fullest - it's like the original Hellboy has merged with the fantasy sequences of Pan's Labyrinth. All this gorgeousness and grotesquery - the troll market, Tooth Fairies, the Golden Army itself - makes for a visual feast, but it also weighs down the action sequences. When there's so much to look at and so many details to play with, it becomes harder to block out action sequences that don't look entirely like cartoons. There's nothing here as adrenaline-pumping as Hellboy 1's fight scene in the New York Subway.

Yorkshire Bitter 5.0%. Brewed in Masham by Black Sheep, this beer is described as "a classic and beautifully balanced Yorkshire bitter combining hoppy notes with bittersweet malty undertones and a dry, refreshing finish.". The front label also highlights "Demerara sweetness with full malt body and citrus overtones." I don't have anything else to add to that, except that this is a pleasant and highly quaffable bitter, instantly recognisable as coming from Black Sheep and, yes I can detect the Demerara sugar lurking in the background.

I can just about vote for the Conservatives with a clothes peg on my nose, and doubtless I will do so in a few weeks' time. But I won't work for it. The frustration is simply too great. I would much rather offer criticism and praise from the sidelines, according to mood. It is not a good thing to be contemptuous of any organisation whilst an officer (however lowly) within it.
The tears began to well up in her eyes. What she wanted more than anything was for someone to help her-- to wash her hair, take her to bed, call her boss, and maybe run to the drugstore to pick up some Gravol.
The contracts cited by AFP included the 114 million euro (RM457 million) one paid by the Malaysian government to Perimekar. The second, called “C5 contract of engineering business,” was concluded in August 2000 between DCNI, a subsidiary of DCN, and Thales International Asia worth some 30 million euro (RM132 million). The third was the “consulting agreement” signed in October 2000 between Thint Asia and Terasasi.

I once encountered someone who said there was nothing redeemable about his mother and he was in his 60′s. I found that sad. As a child, we can internalize negativities and hold anger and resentment. As an adult, we must look deeper and be that bridge – be that connection. It was sad to me that a person could be so incredibly bitter towards someone who gave him life. If you can’t find a single positive thing about your parents, then you probably will lead a very bitter and disconnected life.

Two children bring their mothers (fathers/teachers who ever) a problem, one adult says, “Stop telling tales; go and sort it out yourself.” Second adult stops what they are doing, completely focusses on the child – they may go and help sort out the problem, they may not (more about this later). Which child is more likely to tell another tale?

Throughout this presentation there have been arguments made for its political, aesthetic, cultural, historical, spiritual value, but nothing can be effectively done to save or restore this building in its current state and with its history. It’s completely, utterly hopeless.
1. Stay far away from any company or course that ‘guarantees’ you’ll make ‘X’ amount of money in a certain period of time. Even if their product is amazing they can’t guarantee a thing because they don’t know you. They have no idea how hard you’ll work or how seriously you’ll take your business.
There have been various theories suggested as to why this was the case, and I thought it useful to look at these, and the implications of the Cadder case for the testing of the video tape.

I promise to get on to the content soon but must just add that Heriot's stylish cover shows a huge dragon clutching and gnawing diamonds. It's a nice image but I would just like to point out that there is no dragon in the story and the only diamond in the book is the name of a town. If I were a paid-up Ann McCaffrey or Christopher Paolini fan and had bought this handsome hardback on the jacket's promise, I might want my money back!

Upon graduation in 2003, Tanya began working full time at Wealth Management Group, LLC in Danvers, MA & continued her passion for performing. She spent the ’05, ’06, and ’07 seasons cheering for New England’s favorite Professional Football Team. During her years with the team she was selected to travel overseas with the Air Force Reserves to entertain troops from all branches of the military. Tanya and five other women from her squad visited Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Germany, and Qatar. She was also selected as one of 8 women to travel to China in 2007 to promote American Football. In addition Tanya was a Boston Bruins Ice Girl for the the 2008-2009 season.

I am excited about this change in my life I want to live more sustainably and I want to teach my daughter to also live as sustainably as possible. The hardest part for me will be when I need to take my daughter somewhere. I see many people with their kids in their bike trailer but I won’t do that because I don’t trust motorists enough. Another hard part will be drying clothes during these beginning days of summer.

I was really happy with the result though. The texture is not as dense as regular NY cheesecake due to the addition of the fruit puree and I'm loving the tropical flavor! One thing I learn about making baked fruit-flavored cheesecake (at least for mango or mango passion fruit) is that the flavor concentrates and the color becomes stronger after baked. I'm making notes of all the things I need to modify for next time but until I get it perfected, I won't post the recipe just yet.

Well, this “friend” is just weird….on top of being just plain manipulative. There are so many specifics that I want to go into because you will laugh and cringe simultaneously. Like America’s Funniest Home Videos. But better. But I fear the wrath. It’s the ones that are patient enough to hit you hard over the long haul that you have to watch out for…it’s always the patient ones. Maybe once I have the Atlantic Ocean between us I will have the gall to go into more detail then…
Anyway, back to this picture, it reminded me a little of what I’ve just written. I’ve always regarded myself as the red connection. The outsider, the one that’s different. Made to be because the others are joined together and you’re left on your own. I’ve not really seen that as a problem, because I’m very independent, I’ve had to be!
Humility is something that does not come easily to human beings. Most of us feel at times that we are better than, or more deserving than, or more entitled than at least someone. However, humility is a crucial virtue when it comes to having a right relationship with God.

Stunts: (7/10) – Some of the physical action in Wrath is actually surprisingly brutal and fun to watch. Even if Ares feels like he lacks a real sense of divinity for example, at least scenes where he and Perseus hash it out feel nicely executed and fun to watch. There’s some cool physical work involving fighting the chimera, and traversing Hepahestus’ labyrinth, and something that Wrath really did end up improving is the quality of the stunts. Clash seemed to rely on special effects more often for its action scenes, and at least Wrath manages to pull off some more old-fashioned battles every now and again, which makes them hit harder and feel more believable. That being said though, I found that some of the action scenes can be a bit choppy and difficult to follow, taking away from some of the otherwise impressive stunts. Even if there’s some patchy spots in some of the action scenes though, all in all, Wrath’s stuntwork is an improvement over the original film, and that counts for something in a sequel.

It was on that same afternoon I saw Paul Andrews. The heat had done little to compromise his dress sense. Although he wore shorts, his buttoned shirt made me, with my bare chest, feel somewhat under dressed, even for drinking lager in the park. He was looking for an ice-cream van; I told him I was looking for a new team to play for. When I explained the extent of the situation he was as surprised and disappointed as I could have expected Paul Andrews to be. He wondered off into the horizon looking for ice-cream with a sheepish look on his face.
This is the pergola at the back of the yard. The fence down the center of it marks the center of the yard. There is an old grape vine along the fence and M now has it tied to the pergola in order to train it along the top. He’s also planted grape vines on either end (where the wire cages are) and a lilac at the center front. In a couple of years, this will be a lovely shady place to sit on those hot summer afternoons.

Applying soft paraffin additionally helps to get rid lice. Out of this process and diligent combing is usually not enough to get rid of these pests from your home. Cover your head with a shower cap and leave on overnight. What do I do if treatment fails? What to do when faced with an attack and what treatments recommended as effective? What sort of insect you can expect to see and how you can prevent infestation of head lice? You should didn’t share brushes, combs, hair pieces, hats, bedding and clothing with someone who has lice.
There's only one thing we know for sure, even if some of us don't feel comfortable admitting it. They are, like all Muslims-even the best of them-mentally enslaved to the mentality of a savage, seventh century death cult, and the only peace possible to achieve with them is going to require the shedding of a hell of a lot more blood than has thus far been shed.
So here’s the plan. Fitness Magazine’s March issue has a “Dream Physique” plan that will help you get your “dream physique” in 21 days. So, that’s what I’m going to start with. This is a workout only plan. There is no meal plan to accompany it which is good because as I mentioned before this is not a diet. This workout was designed by Marco Borges and he says that a “five-days-a-week commitment is the key to both weight loss results and making a routine stick.” So I’m going to put that to the test because I need something that will stick and give me results. Here is a link to the moves that I’ll be performing each week: www.fitnessmagazine.com/turnaround This is Borges’ 21-day transformation plan:

If that little pup had stayed in the willows because of his fear, another predator would have gotten to him and his life would have ended. There is no need to remain in the world if you have stopped short of following Christ. Today is the day of Salvation and Jesus offers it freely. He died on the cross, shed ALL of His precious blood to pay the price for your sins and make a way for you to escape Hell. He died for you, you personally because He loves you. God raised Him up from the grave three days later and He rose victorious over death, hell and the grave. He has won life for everyone who will come to Him and place their faith in Him. As a Christian, sometimes we need to remind ourselves of this great Victor we have as a Saviour. There is NOTHING He has not conquered and defeated! My God is my Refuge, my Hope!

That’s the world our choices over the last three decades or so have been preparing for us, and for our grandchildren’s grandchildren. In such a world, the people who will have the most to offer their communities, their societies, and the biosphere that supports all our lives will be those who have the courage, now, to walk away from the consumer economy and its smorgasbord of dubious pleasures, and learn, now, how to get by with less, use their own capacities of body and mind, and work with the patterns and processes of nature. For the time being—specifically, until we get close enough to the crisis period that even the most nonviolent challenge to the existing order calls down massive violence in response—protest can still accomplish goals worth pursuing, especially if activists wake up once again to the power of personal example; over the longer run, though, it’s the change on the individual, family, and community level that so many of today’s activists reject as pointless that have the most to offer the world.

Me and my high-school friends had our yearly out-of-country trip last Feb 10-16. Our destination would be Bali, Indonesia but since there are no direct flights from Manila to Bali, we booked flight going to Jakarta, and then stay there for about a day and then go to Bali.
We think we're isolated and absorbed in our own activities. We don't believe we belong to a larger realm. Why should we? Our vision extends only to as far as we can see. But this is one of those times we need to stop seeing, and just think about what we can't. Every incident eminates ripples beyond our own sphere.
And you think it stopped there? The final sweet course was a heavenly honey maize cake. Served with sweet corn and smoked meringue swimming in a shallow milk and honey bath. So basically we rolled home. Full as eggs… and running out of petrol. Thankfully we got home. And that was that weekend.

Good luck, my dear friend. This particular Mercury retrograde is retrograde in your sign! All kinds of people, information, and events from the past are swirling around you now. Ex-partners might be on the scene. But on a day-to-day basis, so many details in your life seem to be piling up, you feel like you're losing control. You forget things, misplace things, or lose things. You might be blowing appointments, or held up with delays, or just feel generally overwhelmed by life. Don't worry! We all have of these times when we are up to our armpits in alligators. Remind yourself that this will pass. (Especially if you drink a lot of water.) A month from now - all this is a memory.
I'm aware that some people believe that God sends hardships to test them this way. We lose people we love, we suffer great disappointments in life and grieve over losses. Personally, I don't believe God sends these things.
You both wrote the fictional parts of this documentary and directed it – what made you want to focus on this particular subject in the first place?
I've been asked one time or another by those who are curious about the path that I have chosen. Some have asked me, "You're not a Christian and you don't follow Christian rules, what are you, a devil worshiper?" I've also been told once or twice, "It is stated in the Bible that thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." And my personal favorite, "You can do magic? Do you do black or white magic?"
A terrible community constitutes itself in opposition to an opponent and, in that opposition, closes in on itself and begins to rot. Some say that Olympia, once home to ELF cells, the diffuse network of Port Militarization Resistance, and a broad community of anarchists, has become little more than a stale, dusty closet, a cafe-to-show circuit, a green-washed, gentrifying haven of the left. In short, a terrible community. COMMUNE is an experiment. On the negative side, it exposes that Olympia runs business as usual despite its high activist-per-capita ratio and radical reputation. But the film also reveals the existence of many different communes, spreading on their own, outside of anarchist or radical circles.
because that was the question about his girl
She is very much so the same sweet mare that she was before, but more alert and very protective of the colt. She bumped herself up several ranks for the sake of the baby - before she was at the bottom of the back, and now she is giving the other mare that she is turned out with (who was highly ranked above her) some serious grief about getting too close to her baby. The colt himself is very inquisitive and curious and cute - I like him. I like her a heck of a lot more, and having him around means I can't exactly just take her out and groom her whenever I want, but there you are. At some point he'll be bigger, and then we can see about getting her back to being handled a bit more.
Numero 2: Real piñatas are exciting and dangerous. Someone usually ends up crying from being clunked on the head. Kids are let loose to grab all the candy they can, by means fair or foul. The piñatas I’ve been to here (admittedly, most of which I was hosting) tend to be more “fair” with Moms evenly dividing out the candy afterwards….heh heh, and making sure no one gets clobbered. I’ve heard that in Mexico piñatas can still be made out of clay pots…that would definitely add an element of danger, with shards flying into the group of children!

Then it's time for the most important part: walking the runway. A couple of seconds before it was my turn, I got a little bit nervous – what if I fall down? But the moment when I stood there, with all those people looking at me, I felt very confident. 'Don't think and look straight ahead ' was all that went trough my head, only the moment when I turned around and walked away I realised that I didn't fell, and my shoes and dress were still at the right place! Great! Then off to the backstage again were I had to change quickly into the next outfit, time for the next round!

Luckily, being a holiday for much of the country, traffic was light and the horror only lasted 15 minutes before we arrived at the office. Swallowing big gulps of fresh air I got out of the cab and shakily handed over the fare...."keep the change mate" I tell him, "have a good one, drive safely". "Very good, very good" I hear him saying as I slammed the door shut and on legs like snapped candles ,walked towards the building. I would be passing on breakfast....
Blogging can be a wonderfully versatile form of self (and public) expression: you can use it as a journal; to showcase your art (photography, painting, comics, short stories, longer stories...); to share a subject you're knowledgeable about, or to document the process as you learn about a brand new subject; to keep people up-to-date on a community project; to provide support and information, to make connections with others, and a thousand other uses. Basically? Blogging is really cool! In this workshop, we'll aim to have every attendee figure out what they want their blog to be about, then set up an account and blog with Blogger (a free platform that lets you create and customize blogs). We'll also dicuss networking with other bloggers, building a readership, and other relevant blogging basics. Though this is a one time workshop, there's the possibility, if attendees are interested, in continuing to learn and share through a blogging club. Experienced bloggers who want to share their knowledge and experience are also very welcome to attend!

I adhere the DSP onto the flap of the purse and then ran the purse through the Vintage Wallpaper embossing folder. To do this you actually have to run it through the big shot twice to cover the entire purse with texture. I used the Paper Piercer to pierce a hole in the top of both of the sides of the bag and the front of the bag just under the slit. Then you simply put a piece of sticky strip on the two side tabs, fold on the score lines, and adhere the tabs inside the front and back of the purse to form it. Super easy!
It won't be truthful to say everything went according to the plan... Ordy was under the impression that their hubbies would be in tow- half way to Tennessee I got a text that said it was "us girls".... ruh-roh. I didn't even know how to break the news to Ordy... so I didn't. Poor guy got blindsided when we pulled up to Laina's cabin and there were no boys in sight... He thought I suckered him into a girl's trip! Aw, I would never ever ever do that!!! After a five minute pow-wow and me explaining myself to him, he really did put his game face on and was a real trooper! Another reason why I am obsessed with that boy, he woke up at 5 am, picked me up, and drove me to Tennessee just to go thrifting with a bunch of girls. He's the best.
But anywho, for IDUD, I wanted to show her more ladylike. She may be a vixen to men, but she doesn't seem to have any particular dislike of women. Other then if they jack with her plants. so I did Poison Ivy on her way to the Garden Club. I think she'd adore it. No clear face in any of the pictures, because I wanted it dark and like the dark nature of women. So much imagery of Poison Ivy seems to be that, kind of a mother nature thing.
Once and a while you come across a hotel that is not just a place to stay and sleep but a place to become increasingly obsessed with within the first 40 minutes you're there. You can't blame me. There are golden anchors dangling from balconies, pewter tubs you could drown in in every room with bubble bath and roses all around, the warmest coziest white towels everywhere you look, movie selections, an outdoor light wood patio surrounded by vines looking out into the industrial remanence of the sky at sundown. The bed.... I can't even get near it because i am 100% sure that if i put one foot on it i'll sleep for a week straight. There is a bright white tiled shower that feels like you're standing in the middle of a tropical storm naked. Washing yourself with coconut & vanilla shampoo. The door to our room leads straight downstairs to the back door of the Pub. Since 1841, The Fox and Anchor is tucked away on a beautiful ancient English street, cobbled and uneven and welcoming to everyone.

Today, we seem to have reached a turning point. Perhaps not a conscious one, but just like the changes brought about by rising wealth, an inevitable one. The money has run out, the opportunities for the individual have declined and many people are perhaps waking up to what has gone, and just how much we really rely on each other. Yet, in wishing for old ideas of community to return, we must also be careful not to look down those terraced streets with rose-tinted spectacles.
So 3 biopsies later and some bandages slapped on, I left and went and picked up Vince. And with the regular chaos of the rest of the day, I completely forgot all about them. They were still numb, so I didn’t even feel the areas until right around when we were hurrying to get to soccer practice on time.

These days, crazes seem built to last. But back then, one after another passed through our lives: frisbees, spacehoppers, skateboards - you name it, we had it. What we never had, though don't think we didn't toy with the idea, was our own pair of roller skates.

Dec 29th – feels like a kid sneaking to get online. 3 hilarious things from today - 1) took the forever long dirt road here & stopped to pick about 4 people when they yelled to the ones behind them & so on. Next thing we know there are 25+ back there, 2) saw a chicken & a goat fight AND have it on video, 3) took a 15 min shower & as soon as George got in, the power went off. You should've heard him scream. Bahaha! Night!

Doyle prodded, “So, what’s the plan? The press will be merciless when they find out she left you. It’ll make front page headlines all over the country, which, I might add, won’t do your image any good. We need to come up with a plausible story to head this off.”
Well someone was impressed by my insightful copy, because CBS Outdoor's PR company, Edelman, invited me to the awards that took place last night at the Getty Gallery (thanks, Katie, and hello Will).
President Zardari had planned a private visit to visit the holy shrine at Ajmer—a much revered Sufi saint’s burial place. Obviously he hoped that the Indians would do something besides just extend courtesy and protocol. There are those who think that the visit to the shrine was orchestrated to create an opportunity for a meeting where the two leaders could speak frankly. If this was not the case then the options for the Indians were to just let it remain a private visit or to extend an invitation for an official visit with all its implications or to do what they did—turn it into a kind of working visit. This worked well because from all accounts the visit was a success and achieved much in terms of understanding and trust. The Indians seem to have come to the conclusion that Mr Zardari and his son are people they can work with.

I should trust myself more. This is a challenge because I haven’t been very self-aware in the past. I think this is linked to my devaluation of my self-worth. Due to my abuse I haven’t felt that I was very valuable, so trusting my own feelings over other’s opinions still is a challenge. So maybe this is God telling me to use the gift of wisdom he has given me. Maybe my reluctance to continue therapy with T is His way of telling me that I need to find someone else.

I’ve been recycling glass jars by slowly replacing the smaller plastic food containers we’ve been using. But, despite having my husband really go at that sticky residue, we just couldn’t get it all off. Enter the internet where I found various suggestions including peanut butter. I thought “Why not?” and gave it a try. Worked brilliantly! Smooth some on the jar, use a rag or one of those scrubber sponges to go over the area, and rinse. Who knew? (Apparently a lot of people – just not me.)
I have one more room to dust and vacuum before I call it quits for the day. If you drop in over Easter weekend, you are welcome in any of the main floor rooms but don't you dare go upstairs! The beds will be made but I can't guarantee that bunnies won't be up there to greet you, and they won't be the Easter variety. I think this one has become a permanent resident but I don't remember buying her that coffee mug.
Yes! For me it was important and empowering. I had a good friend Terry that had gone through it a year before. I immediately felt I should have been more sympathetic to her, listened to her better, and I should have asked more questions. But she understood, never felt I was insensitive, and she volunteered to answer every tiny question I had, happily.

In 2001 I had my twins and came home to Scotland; at around the same time I discovered YA books (I bought them on the pretence of building a library for my kids’ future, but read them all myself). YA was in this golden age, and I found it was what I really wanted to write. I also discovered manuscript advice services like Hilary Johnson’s, and I can’t recommend them highly enough.

This Psalm is a beatitude and it stands at the front of our most ancient song book/book of prayers. The Psalmist puts before us two paths. On one path walks the blessed person; on the other walks the wicked. And if the blessed one never steps foot onto the path of the wicked, we can be sure and certain that the wicked person never steps foot on the path of the righteous person. The Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked? It appears not so much since their way will be destroyed.
Sports chatter is a very common subject for small talk and is a plague upon my existence. There is no good way to handle the situation, but invariably it happens to me almost every day. Not many situations are more awkward and disconcerting for me

One of the things our Kaiser Optifast group leader emphasizes, especially now that we are out of the Phase 1 rapid weight loss phase, is that to live with a meal plan for the long-term, it has to be foods we like! If we are eating stuff to lose weight or maintain weight loss but we don’t feel happy and satisfied, or we are trying to keep eating stuff we don’t care for, it won’t work for the long-term. We’ll get bored, or feel deprived, and want variety, treats, etc. It’s human nature, since humans are basically pleasure-driven creatures…
Many girls wish that they could magically get their ex-boyfriend to like them again, or even for something as simple as bigger boobs and longer hair. If given the chance I’m sure that we’d all change something about ourselves or our lives so when our heroine Lex and her best friend George play a mysterious online Sims like game starring not only themselves but also their group of friends who can blame them for tinkering around with the online settings? Giving themselves a better image and adding a few wishful thinking improvements regarding who likes who in the group. But when what’s happening in the game starts also unexplainably happening in real life too Lex and George feel like they’ve won the jackpot. They have ultimate control over their friend’s looks, love lives and even personalities and can change things for the better right at their fingertips. But sometimes what we think we want isn’t always what we need which is something that Luisa Plaja explores to extremes in this weirdly wonderful story.
We also had the opportunity of going on late night hikes and seeing (or as much as we could!) the landscape in a different perspective. Of course there was the occasional scream, but it was all in good fun!
Informational session: An informational session consisting of several presentations and discussion will be held from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. May 25 in Mass Media and Technology Hall Auditorium. During this informational session, several topics will be discussed, including the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the composition and breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the war and genocide in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995, Islam and Culture in Bosnia, and contemporary Bosnian life in America.
As they got closer I stepped clear of that girl and unzipped my jacket at those two guys. When I did the guy threw down the bottle and they walked by cussing at me. If someone challenges you after you indicate you are armed, say "I don't have a gun." Then they will know you do.
I asked 002 to watch after the twins. I can't remember if it was while I went to work or if it was while I went to a doctor's appointment with 007. I was taking them to someone's house to watch them and asked 002 to help them not be sad while I was gone. I liked to give her something to do because it helped her stay focused and not think about why I wasn't there.
"Red Meat Does Not Raise Risk of Cancer, Heart Disease"
This book is bursting with fascinating facts about daily life in the 1300′s- facts that might not be mentioned in other history books. Some of the common misconceptions of 14th century people are challenged as well- the great unwashed that eat slop? Barbarians that kill and mutilate without a second thought? This myths are shown to be untrue, with evidence and argument to back it up. The dialogue reads easily, is uncomplicated and appeals to anyone- whether they are new to the 14th century, or a regular visitor.
DSLR cameras capture their images on a silicon semiconductor referred to as a “image sensor.” Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras use either a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) or CMOS (Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) image sensor. Most point and shoot cameras use a CCD sensor (excluding cameras like the Nikon D3000) while almost all DSLR’s use a CMOS image sensor. CMOS image sensors derive their name from the way they are manufactured. They are cut from a CMOS wafer which is cheaper to produce then a CCD wafer, provides less power consumption, and also allow for more involved circuitry along side of the photosite array.

So, the next day, I plopped myself down at the table at lunch and told the lunch bunch the “Vickie story.” When they finished laughing hysterically at me, one of my friends (I shall call her Sharon), had the nerve to ask me, after she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes. “So, are you going to write to the real Ale-Alejandro?” And my answer, in a school building, in a professional teacher voice, was, “Are you F*cking kidding me?????” And they all cracked up again.

Good. Now you’ve got some goals; some things you know you want to change. But one of the biggest problems for people when setting SMART goals is the T: Time-sensitive. They just can’t answer for themselves one big question: when!?! When will you hit that goal by? - and as they start trying to answer the question of when the excuses and “reasons” start popping up (reason is just code for excuse, right?).

As she crossed the room, the clapping hands ringing in her ears, she risked the briefest glance at the man in the second row.

Tim and Laurie Thornton amazed us as they skillfully played, sang and told stories of what the Lord had done in their lives. At one point in the concert, my mind started to drift and the thoughts began to eat away at my brain, "What if it doesn't work out? What if he breaks my heart? What if this isn't right?" And in that moment I heard the Lord whisper to me, "He is your gift." All of the sudden a million other questions entered my mind, "For now? For this year? Forever?" But no answer was given... just that he was my gift.

Merry Christmas!! The Yuletide is one of my favorite seasons. The caroling, the presents, the repetitive television specials, I love all of it. But the joy of Christmas hides a darker, more dangerous element, an element which threatens the lives of people around the world. Most people are sadly unaware these dangers, so I’ve taken it upon myself to educate the general public. I’m referring, of course, to the Krampus, the monster of Christmas.
You know how I’m a picky eater and I won’t eat stuff simply because I don’t like the sound of it? Well, on Saturday I met my BFF Lisa Gioia-Acres and her cooler-than-moi daughter, Adrian, for lunch at the Texas de Brazil steakhouse in Town Square. Why so fancy-schmancy? It was Adrian’s birthday and she’s worth it.

As sad as it is, I have several friends that have had much darker days than I. Many, such as the one above, have had not been able to take their babies home from the hospital. One, very recently, lost his four year old son in a tragic accident. Another lost the love of her life to breast cancer 10 months ago (still missing you Jen, love you Cathy).

But with the weird and the bad, came good (as life usually does), I officially got in a relationship with...Will. Ha, I felt weird talking about him on my blog, but now, I don't care. It might've been a little sudden, but it didn't feel that way to us. I've known him for five years, and he's the greatest guy I've ever known. He treats me completely different than guys have in the past...and that means something to me. All my family and closest friends can see a change in me, in this guy, and that also confirmed it for me. The feelings I get with him are just so different, and yes, a little scary. I'm falling for him fast because it feels so effortlessly, but with that, you have your guard up. My step-mother Kim, told me it's okay to let yourself be vulnerable, and just feel what you are feeling. She's right. I say it every time, but everyone deserves a cleans slate, even if you have been hurt every single time. I'm scared, but I want to take this chance on something great. I teased Will the other day; in five years, we don't have one good picture with each other. Guess we'll just have to fix that won't we?! Just so thrilled with this. He gets me better than a lot of people do, and every day I find something else we have in common with one another. I love it, I truly do.
For the first time in franchise history, the Predators topped the Red Wings in points, thus giving Nashville home ice advantage. This isn’t, however, the first time Nashville and Detroit have faced one another in the first round of the playoffs. Nashville and Detroit met in both 2004 and 2008, but Detroit powered through both times, ending the Predators from the get-go. This year is different. Nashville has been predicted over Detroit in almost all circumstances, and for once, the Red Wings find themselves on the underdog side of the fence.
Mind you, I don’t let my kids to sit on the couch for hours on end every day. During the week (when I’m parenting solo) I limit the amount of time the TV is on. I do my best to keep them entertained with books, arts & crafts, dancing and playtime. However, when the dishes call or dinner needs to be prepared, I have no problem turning on my electronic-babysitter for 10-15 minutes at a time.

I don’t think the solution to the Groupthink process is to eliminate it. Collaborative work has brought about a lot good material. What needs to be eliminated or mitigated is the sense of anxiety of influence.
The Padawan is also doing great. She has passed her due date, and has now been promoted in status from externalized fetus to official baby. She even looks like one now, all rosy cheeks and chubby belly. The health visitor came a couple of days ago, and she was at her birth weight plus 10%. She’s eating very well, slurping down 100 mls at a time with no persuasion necessary. Just the opposite, we have to slow her down or she gets gripey. She actually slept for four hours last night. Four hours!!

The growing health consciousness of Americans is probably the most important reason for the surge of interest in vegetarianism. Nutrition experts have built up convincing evidence that there are major problems with the conventional American diet, which is centered around meat products that are high in cholesterol and saturated fat, while low in fiber. Heart disease, cancer and diabetes, which cause 68% of all deaths in America, are all believed to be influenced by diet.
Three children...14yo identical twin girls(adopted locally as infants) and a 7 yo boy(adopted from China in 2010). All are adopted. None look like me or my husband. We consider it a call from God to parent children. We don't feel proficient. It isn't the same.
It’s truly flabbergasting that this film was written and directed by the same guy that directed Body Heat and The Big Chill and that wrote Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back as well as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Those films, especially those last two, are just truly iconic cinematic gems, films that as soon as you hear their name a particular scene or moment or piece of music comes to mind; Darling Companion, on the other hand, seems to be the exact opposite of that for some reason. It’s the sort of film that you’ll have to think for a while to remember what it was when people ask you about just a few months from now, the kind of film that is just too mild-mannered for it to make any kind of impact, the kind of film in which the stakes are just too low for you to really care about what happens in it.

We have seen that the book of Esther lays out a fairly accurate spiritual chronology of God’s gospel program. It begins with Vashti representing Israel. Then she is put away as Israel was at the cross. The gathering of virgins to Shushan relates to all those brought into the churches during the church age. The discovery of the rebellious plot of the 2 doorkeepers, and their judgment points to the end of the church age. The promotion of Haman and his desire to kill Mordecai and the Jews clearly relates to Satan taking his seat in the temple, and the image of the beast that was set up in the churches. Any not worshipping it were to be killed. The spiritual chronology continues up until May 21. Let’s see how the book of Esther makes the connection with the date of May 21. And in doing so, we will also see that May 21 is locked in as the beginning day of judgment.

Keep in mind that small children can be rascals. All you have to do is leave them unattended a minute playing by the car when they realize they left their favorite toy inside. Next thing you know they are playing in the car w/out realizing how hot is and perhaps even trap themselves inside. When we have that mom moment "hey it's too quiet, what's wrong?" it may be too late.

The Kay Bob’s name is a play on kebabs. The meat line-up is kebab-esque in preparation and it’s a simple choice of seven combinations right now. Each sandwich is a puffy, white, flat bread wrap. The Tammie Rae brings ties together barbecue chicken, Cole slaw and melted Jack cheese. It’s straightforward and satisfying. The Uncle Bob is a burger wrapped up with lettuce, tomato and your choice of sauce. The horseradish sauce is a bit tame, but the quality of the local beef stands out with a pleasant sweetness. The sides include crispy and thick-cut sweet potato chips; a mellow and chilled black bean and corn salad; skinny hand-cut fries; and flavorful sweet sesame slaw with a crunch from Raman.

I am a barefoot enthusiast, and have practically given up wearing shoes all together! For many years I described my brand of spiritual connectedness as standing barefoot on a sun-warmed stone in the middle of a cold rushing stream. I have done just that in many streams and places in the northern hemisphere. If I knew then what I know now, the four months I spent hiking along the Appalachian Trail would have been done barefoot. No doubt the voyage of Simplicity to the southern latitudes will be shoeless.

So, did you miss me last Wednesday? I was on my Jolly Holidays. We spent a fabulous week in London doing the "Tourist Thing"!!! We saw all the sights Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Downing Street, Tower Bridge etc. We visited Kew Gardens, The Science Museum, The Royal Observatory at Greenwich and The British Museum. Of course we also had time for some serious shopping too - Harrods, Fortnum & Masons, Covent Garden and Hamleys to name a few. I even managed a trip to Blade Rubber Stamps - a great rubber stamp and craft shop in Holborn!!!

The whole concert reminded me strongly of the “Dreigroschenoper”, but less interesting, less captivating, less haunting. In short: I am glad I had a chance to attend this free concert, but unlike a large part of the audience, I was not enchanted.

While the Blip Festival and the chiptune scene grow larger every year, chip artist continue to be vexed by the common assumption that what they do is some sort of novelty, or worse, just “video game music.” To many artists, the hardware itself is more of an instrument than a game machine, and lumping all music made with a Game Boy into one oversimplified category is akin to claiming that all music made with a guitar is essentially the same.

(The other two being, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Lady Vengeance) That being said, all three of the films stand alone and are only linked in that each is a meditation on Vengeance and the fact that none of the films give a color by numbers revenge story. The Oldboy story is based on Japanese manga. Typically a revenge film is one man addressing a great wrong, but Park shows us a complex world of equally complex characters, where many may have arguable rights to revenge, but seeking it seldom does anyone any good only escalating the atrocities and pain for all parties.

In our text the apostle had opportunity to admonish all concerned but no one would listen. That word “admonish” means to warn. They might have considered him a mere pessimist. After all, he was but a prisoner and usually prisoners have a hidden agenda – like escape. What they might not have realized was that Paul had a greater desire to go toRomethan any of them.

Accepting the premise that it's ludicrous to pretend to comprehensively cover the themes of perhaps the most important turning point in our nation's history in 30 minutes, we do try to talk about what we think was lost in 1865, what is always lost when there is change, and the role of Catholics and the Papacy in and with the Confederacy.

Much credit to Oliver La Farge, who continues to surprise me by saying something interesting and even possibly relevant about the situation for Native Americans in the early 1930s. I know I came in with low expectations, so it’s not as though I’m reading Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. But Laughing Boy is proving very immersive in what feels to me (based on my limited historical knowledge) like a realistic scenario for young Native Americans in the Southwest at the time. Laughing Boy’s story explores a lot of territory—what is expected of a man, how tensions between tribes (the Pah-Utes and the Navajo, principally) dominated their experience and allowed the “Americans” to play one off the other, etc. But I’m increasingly fascinated by Slim Girl, who’s proving to be a very complex young woman—raised in a boarding school (a place so awful, she tells Laughing Boy on their wedding night to kill their children if the Americans ever come to take them off to a school), not quite “native” enough for the Navajo but never “white” enough for the Americans, savvy in business but unable to keep a lid on all her emotions. La Farge does a good job, I think, of drawing out her inner life. Here’s an extended example from immediately after she’s convinced Laughing Boy to elope with her:
I have mentioned before that my university didn’t offer anything in the way of mentoring schemes and only offered pro-bono work in my final year so I had very little access to local firms compared to some universities. A big disappointment.

Envy. Do I envy the wealthy? Do my friends? None of us make a million dollars a year, but I have trouble conjuring up a recent conversation where one of us expressed envy toward those who do make that amount of money. I think the young man missed the point, it’s not about envy, but it is about fairness. We are in a big mess and we are all in the mess together, so if you are going to make cuts to social programs it is only fair to raise taxes on those who make over a million dollars a year too. Now I understand that life is not always fair. I also know that when you have a country full of people who see that the game is rigged and it’s not fair, you create a grave mistrust and mistrust leads to other problems. In a lot of instances that mistrust is already in place. Neither The Ryan Plan nor the Buffet Rule will become law. And they won’t become law because there is so much money in Washington that our elected officials are:

As polls in recent years show, a majority of Israelis supports a two-state solution. And for good pragmatic reason: Israelis see a Palestinian state as an existential necessity for Israel itself, a means of preserving their country's Jewish majority and democratic identity.

Work is going well. I've been working on some projects I'm enjoying and that are requiring me to use the ol' noodle in a good way. And I'm busy. Very, very busy. My annual (not really annual since I haven't had one since 12/09) performance review is coming up next week, so you know. There's that. Last time, I got a whopping 2% raise after enduring a 2-year salary freeze. Who knows what will happen this time. In this economy, I'm just incredibly thankful to have a job.
But, if I learn some of the fundamentals, if I learn how to read the music and what notes sound good together, if I begin to grasp the ideas of rhythm and timing, then I just might get a few of you to stick around.
Today he seems a little less willing. When I sit him on the potty, within 20 – 30 seconds, he’s saying “All done,” without having done anything in the potty. I’m making him sit for at least a couple of minutes, but (a) my experience yesterday indicated that if he’s going to do anything into the toilet, it’s going to be within the first few seconds, and (b) I don’t want to force him to sit on the potty longer than he’s willing to sit and thus make the pottying experience a negative one for him.
OMG, “RAPE EACH OTHER HETERO” — that has to go on a t-shirt somewhere. I picture a Jersey Shore cast member saying it to his other well ab-ed and tanned cohort: “My buddy was looking so good after that gym workout and tanning session that I almost cruised him in the locker room, but instead we raped each other hetero. Now, we’re going to the club to get some hos.” WHAT IN GOD’S NAME. I CAN’T. I CAN’T CONTINUE. Who knew poor test scores were a result of raping one another hetero. And if people are raping each other hetero, aren’t they solving her problem? You’re logic is being poorly translated from out of that tin foil, you Crazy Bag O’ Donuts. Wait, what logic?

As in any totalitarian society it then becomes the role of the state controlled popular media to promote the approved doctrine in the propaganda beamed into the homes of the population by means of misreported news or fictional drama bearing no resemblance to reality, with the effect that, over time, the lie becomes a universally accepted truth.

If we can, we must view our disquieted lives as a great blessing: the waking of a slumbering Church; one at ease with temporal blessings. While the rationality of man continues to dissolve into a pool of relativism, we who are in Christ are being given great gains. As we think upon all the evils around us, we have to consider our own natures and deal with the inconsistencies I believe we all find within ourselves. Below is a work by Thomas Watson. It details the depth of Adam’s first sin, original sin, and I believe can add insight to the sins we see within ourselves on a daily basis. Not to beat us down as under a whip of legalism, this self-reflection affords us an opportunity to correctly see more clearly our own natures and how desperately we need to flee to the safety of our saviour; to throw ourselves at God and to serve Him wholly as He rightly desires. These stormy seas we live in are meant, in part, to bring us into right standing with Him. And right standing is recognizing Him as a sovereign and Holy God and that without Him we are utterly and totally lost. It is only He that can hold us up with His hand of righteousness.

He wants us to return to God, while he and 300,000 other people are prostrating themselves at the altar of nationalism. The Biblical record is clear that God does not care about maintaining empires. He causes them to be built, and causes them to be destroyed, according to His purposes. That he has no use for blind nationalism should be clear from the fall of Israel and Judaea in the books of the Kings, and of Babylonia in the book of Daniel.

I remember sharing my insights about data early in my career, with a team that saw it differently. Things soured up pretty quickly. I saw myself as part of the team – I was keen to hear their voices and add my own to the mix. I thought I was valuing their input and they likely thought otherwise. I’ve now learned to share the data and offer opportunities for my team to engage with it and draw their own conclusions. If necessary, I now use questions to channel conversations towards important aspects of the data and learn what they think. In most situations, I’ve seen that my team comes up with insights that I have not considered – whether or not I agree with them is irrelevant because they have given me something new to think about. I’ve learned that putting my ideas and opinions on the table is less useful than having my staff make meaning on their own. I do add my voice to the mix, often by sharing my reflections, but I am learning to do this after they have engaged with the ideas and issues.

While I’m having a lovely time seeing friends and family again, there’s absolutely no doubt that Paul is the one who’s enjoying this holiday more than anybody, mostly because he’s being treated as an equal by everybody and given the chance to prove himself capable. In fact, I think this is probably his best holiday for a very, very long time. I have to admit that I was a bit apprehensive about bringing him with me because, what with my disability and his, we're a bit like the blind leading the blind at times, but he hadn't been back since we left to move back to the UK twelve years ago so it was only fair he came too. I'm glad he did. Sometimes you just have to throw yourself into a situation and hope for the best.

The curious thing, of course, is that similar values were also observable in ancient Greece and Rome and may even have been what underlay the city-states of the original human civilization in Mesopotamia. The affinity of the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic people for democracy is certainly very reminiscent of ancient Greek democracy and the early Roman republic and, in turn, the city-states that characterized ancient Greece and Rome are very reminiscent of ancient Mesopotamia. What appears to have happened is that the human race has a great tendency towards centralization of government -- seen vividly in the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, in the bureaucratic states of pre-modern China, in various Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Roman, Moghul and Ottoman empires, in the Kings of Mediaeval Europe and in the vast swathe of communist bureaucracies in the 20th century. And this centralizing tendency almost always seems to triumph over an even earlier tendency towards respect for the individual and a form of government that is directly responsive in some way to the popular will. And it is that very early tradition that only the Anglo-Saxons -- and their close relatives in Scandinavia and the Netherlands -- have carried forward into the modern world. Only among the Anglo-Saxons and their close relatives did the power of centralism never quite succeed in squashing human dreams for responsive, respectful and representative government. And it is this dream that conservatives of the English-speaking world carry forward today.

Our hotel in Prague was a renovated 13th century monastery. I knew that when I booked it.
